You can think of it as the Japanese equivalent to something in between Reddit and 4chan, with a more toxic userbase than Reddit and varying levels of moderation. You can use this to burn away time instead of looking at English sites. The site design is very questionable by today's standards, and I will be constantly calling it \"awful\" in this article. The awful site design, combined with the lack of user friendliness, make the site very hard to use , especially for people still learning Japanese. This article will try explaining how to use 2ch/5ch in your browser. So what is this site actually called? \u00b6 \"\u306b\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b\" is how it is widely known. \"\u306b\u3061\u3083\u3093\" is also its shorter name. Despite this, the site was renamed to 5channel due to some some circumstances . Despite this, people still refer to the site as \u306b\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b. It is often written as 2 ch , or \uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b, or \uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093. However, there is a different site, known as Futaba Channel, that is known as 2 chan , that is not related to 2channel. Very confusing. It is officially 5ch now, but I will be referring to the site as 2ch/5ch from now on. URL \u00b6 https://5ch.net/ Front Page \u00b6 What! What part of the site design is awful, you say? Well first, that screenshot is actually taken with an ad-blocker enabled. The site without an ad-blocker has too many ads to be a pleasant experience. And second, the site design is actually very inconsistent , the site design changes across different pages. Only the front page looks good, lol. The front page displays popular threads from the \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u901f\u5831+ (a news board) and \u91ce\u7403\u5b9f\u6cc1\u677f (a \u5b9f\u6cc1 baseball board). While the front page has quite mundane content, there are actually a ton of different boards for different interests. You can access the list of boards by clicking the \u63b2\u793a\u677f button on the top left. Boards \u00b6 There are a LOT of boards, it is more comparable to Reddit subreddits than say, boards on 4chan. Boards have a lot of categorization on 2ch/5ch, this means you can only read stuff you are interested in, but it can also result in a lot of boards becoming dead, as the categorization is too meticulous at times. You may want to try using Ctrl + F to try finding something related to your interests. You can try inputting a keyword (of course, in Japanese!) into the search bar, there is bound to be a thread about it, and from there you can learn what is the suitable board for your type of interests. There is a page that displays links to every single board on a single page: \u63b2\u793a\u677f\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8 . Boards I often view personally are the \u30e9\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\uff01 and \u58f0\u512a boards. Board Page \u00b6 The first box of the board page contains rules, and info about the board. You can see the list of threads in the next box. This is how you will find threads. The number in brackets after the thread name is how many responses the thread has. If you scroll further, you can see previews of the latest bumped threads. This will show the first post (the OP), and the last 50 posts. The \"\u30ec\u30b9\" refers to how many responses the thread has. The \"CP\" refers to how many clicks recently the thread has. (Latest bumped threads view) You need to click on \u5168\u90e8\u8aad\u3080 to view the entire thread. When you click on a thread through the thread list, by default 2ch/5ch will display the first post and the latest 50 posts. You need to click on \u5168\u90e8, or remove /l50 from the URL to view the entire thread. Thread List Dedicated Page \u00b6 There is a dedicated page for each board where you can view a list of all threads, without any other bloat. You can access it by clicking on \u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u5168\u4e00\u89a7\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089 at the top of the thread list, or by editing the URL to include subback.html at the end. The default view is not very good, but you should click \u8868\u793a\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u5207\u66ff and get a view you like. Imgur Links \u00b6 You may notice a lot of people posting Imgur links. This is because 2ch/5ch is a text bulletin board that does not support uploading images. The only way to share images is to use external image hosts. There are browser extensions that aim to improve the 2ch/5ch experience that feature embedding images and tweets. The one I use personally is 5chutil . Responses \u00b6 Responses work in nearly the same way as replies do on sites like 4chan. The oldest responses are displayed first, and the newest displayed last. However, while replies in 4chan threads are counted against all replies across all threads across the entire board (this is why replies have really high numbers), responses in 2ch/5ch threads are counted against how many responses are in that one thread. On 2ch/5ch, the way people respond to other posts is to refer to the number with >> . For example, replying to the first post will be >>1 , replying to the 19th post would be >>19 . On 2ch/5ch, threads will be automatically archived when they reach 1000 responses. You can view those archived threads in the \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0. Archived threads cannot be replied to. \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0 \u00b6 The 2ch/5ch \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0 is where archived threads go. You can view the \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0 by clicking on the \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0\u4e00\u89a7\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089 button at the top of the thread list. Posting \u00b6 You can post on 2ch/5ch by scrolling right to the bottom of the thread and typing in the text box. When posting, make sure you post with courtesy and respect! Follow the 2ch/5ch etiquette and the rules of the board you're posting on. You can easily get banned for trolling on 2ch/5ch and it is really not pretty trying to get unbanned or evade your ban! It is best practice to sage ! when posting! You can start new threads by going to the board page and scrolling to the bottom where it says \u65b0\u898f\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210. Posting Culture \u00b6 Since posting is anonymous, posts may get toxic. People may throw insults around. I think it is nothing compared to 4chan, though. Also, it varies a lot depending on what board you are posting on. Boards like the \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 board have good moderation and does not really get toxic. On the other hand, a sh*thole such as \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u901f(\u5acc\u5132) is pretty much always the underbelly of the Japanese net. People can and will respond negatively to poor quality posts you make and threads you create, and there will be haters everywhere bashing the things you like, it is important to not take these negative responses to heart, and learn to get over them. Despite this, 2ch/5ch is much better regulated than places like 4chan, because 2ch/5ch has more frequent bans, more severe troll prevention measures and very strict limits on what IP addresses can post. How to post outside of Japan \u00b6 Non-Japanese IPs cannot post on 2ch/5ch. 2ch/5ch is very strict on what IP addresses can post on 99% of boards (\u5927\u4f7f\u9928 and Anarchy boards you can post freely). You can view 2ch/5ch just fine outside of Japan, however you can only post with approved Japanese ISP's and mobile carriers. This means usual VPN's don't work, as the ISP needs to be approved too. However there are still ways to get over the posting restriction, but it can get tricky. Method 1: Residential IP address VPN \u00b6 This is the only way I was ever to post on 2ch/5ch, however it can be tricky to get your hands on one, and depending on the service you are using you will constantly be rolling the gacha and seeing what IP addresses haven't already been used by others on 2ch/5ch and already been banned. It is pretty much a cat and mouse game with the moderators of 2ch/5ch. Tuxler \u00b6 Tuxler is a VPN service that lets you use residential IP addresses. It works quite well when you figure out how to use it. I recommend you download the Windows app, not the Chrome extension. Tuxler Windows App . When I tried directly connecting to a Japan location address in Residential mode, it didn't work. However, I realized the software is bugged and there is a workaround to this. You need to first connect to a Datacenter location, THEN a Residential location. (You can stack connections.) So the steps are as follows, 1. Connect to the nearest Datacenter location, (France for me, as I am in the UK.) 2. Then switch to the Residential tab and choose Japan. 3. When the flag at the bottom changes to Japan you know it worked. 4. Try accessing ipleak.net to see what your ISP displays as. It should be something like KDDI, NTT, au, SoftBank, Docomo etc. 5. When you reach the daily limit, connect to another residential VPN first before connecting. (it remembers your original IP) WARNING: Tuxler lets other people use your IP address as a residential VPN too. Make sure you close the app fully (gone from the taskbar icons and Task Manager completely) when you finish using it. \u7b51\u6ce2vpn \u00b6 Also known as SoftEther, or VPN Gate. Out of courtesy for the contributors I will not go into detail but this is also an option. Dedicated Residential Proxy \u00b6 This is quite an expensive option. There are proxy providers aimed at people that do web scraping that provide undetectable residential proxies. A lot of these providers have Japan location residential proxies too. Your safest and most reliable approach to posting on 5ch outside of Japan would be this, but it can be quite costly. Make sure you don't buy an \"ISP Proxy\"! These are just datacenter IPs with a registered dummy ISP. You need a residential or mobile proxy. Method 2: Buy \u6d6a\u4eba \u00b6 2ch/5ch \u6d6a\u4eba (ronin) is like a 2ch/5ch Premium; you have more perks such as heightened spamming abilities and you can post from any IP address. You can buy it here . I am not joking, that is seriously the actual page to buy \u6d6a\u4eba, lmao. But here's the catch: you need Japanese payment details. \u5c02\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6 2ch/5ch dedicated browsers \u00b6 It is usually not recommended to use a web browser to use 2ch/5ch. This is because 2ch/5ch works by you (client) requesting the data (.dat) of the thread and the server making a HTML web page for you. This can cause extra load on the server. That is why 2ch/5ch dedicated browsers are recommended, as they can display threads in a more native way to the thread .dat. Some boards even have restrictions in place where you can only post on a dedicated browser. The major downside of this for Japanese learners is that you can't use Yomichan in them. Recommended 2ch/5ch\u5c02\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6: Windows: Siki Android: Chmate iOS: BB2C Improve the web browser 2ch/5ch experience: 5chutil \u00b6 You can improve the web browser 2ch/5ch experience using the 5chutil extension. Chrome Firefox Greasyfork Userscript This has a lot of useful quality of life improvements. Including: - Improved thread list view, featuring sorting by name, no. of responses(\u30ec\u30b9), CP(\u52e2\u3044) and date. - Imgur and Twitter embeds - Replies by a single user can be displayed in a list when you hover over the number next to their name. - Replies spanning across multiple replies can be displayed in a list when you hover the >> . - Add \"NG Words\" by highlighting text and clicking the button. This can filter stuff you don't want to see. - Able to hide replies of posters you don't like by clicking the + next to their ID. Recommended way to search 2ch/5ch \u00b6 I recommend using Google with the search term site:5ch.net <keyword> . \u7d50\u5c40 No point of using 2ch/5ch?? / \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 introduction \u00b6 2ch/5ch can have a lot of interesting posts, however a lot of threads may be \u30af\u30bd\u30b9\u30ec (crappy threads) and a lot of responses in threads may be \u30af\u30bd\u30ec\u30b9 (crappy responses). It can also be hard to find things on 2ch/5ch. That is where \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8's come in. These sites take interesting threads and only the interesting responses, and put them on a 3rd party site. These sites are also usually specialized in only posting about one topic. For example, there is a Love Live! 2ch matome site that takes threads from the \u30e9\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\uff01 board. Here's \u30d4\u30b3\u30d4\u30b3\u901a\u4fe1 , a \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 that posts threads from video game related 2ch/5ch boards. Here's \u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30e2\u30b6\u30a4\u30af which is more like a general \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8. In my opinion, \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8's are the real Japanese alternative to mindlessly scrolling something like Reddit. You can spend hours being entertained just looking at \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8's. There is a \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 for pretty much any hobby / interest, just search on Google for them. You can see a \u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 recommendation list here: \u3010\u5b8c\u5168\u7248\u3011\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u307e\u3068\u3081\u30b5\u30a4\u30c830\u9078\uff012ch\u306a\u3069\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30eb\u5225\u306b\u8abf\u67fb\uff01 Notorious 2ch/5ch boards \u00b6 The following boards are known for being bad places to be around. These are usually in the \u96d1\u8ac7\u7cfb\uff12 category of boards. You should avoid these, but if you are one of those people, then feel free... - \u306a\u3093\u3067\u3082\u5b9f\u6cc1(any) - \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u901fVIP - \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u901f(\u5acc\u5132) - \u306a\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a - \u6700\u60aa - \u5b66\u6b74 The NSFW (BBSPINK) versions of \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u901f and \u306a\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a can only be accessed with a Japanese IP address. Talk.jp \u00b6 URL: https://talk.jp/ Talk.jp is a spin off of 5ch that was made recently due to disagreements between the terrible owners of 5ch and the owner of the developer of the most popular 2ch/5ch\u5c02\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6, Jane Style. The developer of Jane Style used to have ads placed on the 5ch website, however the owners decided to remove his ads, resulting in him losing that source of income. In response to this, the developer of Jane Style created Talk.jp and removed 5ch support from Jane Style, and made it into a Talk.jp\u5c02\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6. Jane Style was an extremely popular 5ch\u5c02\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6, which means everyone that downloaded the update will no longer be browsing 5ch, but Talk.jp. With that being said, this is not really stealing that much traffic from 5ch. Talk.jp has the most popular boards of 5ch, and features an easier to use web design. Terminology \u00b6 \u30b9\u30ec \u00b6 Thread. \u30ec\u30b9 \u00b6 Response. \u677f \u00b6 Board. sage \u00b6 Usually when you post on 2ch/5ch, the thread will get bumped to the top of the board. You can stop this by putting sage in the Email field when posting. Posting without sage'ing is generally frowned upon among 2ch/5ch users. Names will appear purple for users that posted with sage . \u81ea\u6cbb \u00b6 Basically moderation on 2ch/5ch. Well moderated boards have \"\u81ea\u6cbb\u30b9\u30ec\"'s where you complain to the mods about being moderated. \u5b9f\u6cc1 \u00b6 \u5b9f\u6cc1 on 2ch/5ch refers to discussing an event or something while it is happening. This has often been frowned upon by 2ch/5ch users, therefore most boards disallow \u5b9f\u6cc1'ing by default. Boards that do allow it, have \u5b9f\u6cc1 in the name or \u5b9f\u6cc1OK/\u5b9f\u6cc1\u53ef written in the rules) dat\u843d\u3061 \u00b6 When a thread reaches 1000 replies and is then archived. 2ch/5ch thread raw data is stored in .dat files. Therefore, the dat \"falls\". VIP \u00b6 Originally 20 years ago, this meant boards that got special treatment, but now this kind of has a \"containment\" connotation to it because the boards that have \"VIP\" in the name are really notorious for their posts. Examples include \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u901fVIP . \u30b3\u30c6\u30cf\u30f3 \u00b6 2ch is usually anonymous, however you can post with a name. This is called \u30b3\u30c6\u30cf\u30f3. \u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7/\u9149/\u9ce5 \u00b6 This is similar to \u30b3\u30c6\u30cf\u30f3 , but a \u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7 is made by a special string of characters that only you should know, that becomes another string of characters, this is your \u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7. People may want to post with a \u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7 when they want to be specially identified. !extend::vvvvv:: \u00b6 This is a command you can use in the OP of a 2ch/5ch thread to enable forced \u30b3\u30c6\u30cf\u30f3 mode. This is a troll prevention measure because it means each member can be identified with a \" \uff9c\uff6f\uff81\uff6e\uff72 \" followed by a special code. Well-moderated boards often have this as a requirement for all threads. You also often see this in multiple part threads with templates for the OP. ID's on 2ch reset when the date changes or when you post from a different IP address, so IDs aren't enough. People will post multiple lines of the string !extend::vvvvv:: to remind others to not forget to post it when they make the new OP when the thread dat\u843d\u3061's. A more severe version of this with more v's displays each poster's IP address, however this is more rare. \uff9c\uff6f\uff81\uff6e\uff72 \u00b6 What gets displayed next to your name along with a special code when you post in threads that have !extend::vvvvv:: in the OP. ROM\u308b \u00b6 ( Read Only Memory). Lurking. This is what you will be doing. AA \u00b6 ASCII art. Also includes Shift-JIS art. \u30a4\u30c3\u30c1 \u00b6 The person who posted the OP. From \">>1\" \u4eba\u5927\u6749 \u00b6 An error message that sometimes displays when you try viewing something in the 2ch\u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0. It's a \u8aa4\u5b57 version of \u4eba\u591a\u904e\u304e. It appears when the server that HTML'ify's the .dat's in the \u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0 is overloaded. \u30a2\u30d5\u30a3 / \u30a2\u30d5\u30a3\u30ab\u30b9 \u00b6 \u30a2\u30d5\u30a3 refers to affiliate \u307e\u3068\u3081 sites. These sites take 2ch/5ch\u904e\u53bb\u30ed\u30b0 threads and put them on \u307e\u3068\u3081 sites. These sites have ads all over them, and try to farm clicks which means they are earning money from 2ch/5ch threads. This is extremely frowned upon among 2ch/5ch users, so much so that 2ch/5ch owners copyrighted all the threads on their website, making it illegal to post their threads on other sites. Despite this, \u307e\u3068\u3081 sites exist and they are not going away. The \u30ab\u30b9 is a Japanese word meaning something like \"scum\".","title":"How to use 5ch"},{"location":"2ch/#how-to-use-5ch-2ch","text":"2channel (Japanese: \uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b) (New name: \uff15\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b) is a Japanese anonymous text bulletin board.

However, this is in fact, false. First, let's consider just exactly why this argument exists in the first place. Usually when people say this, they don't know why the argument exists anyway, in other words, most people saying this don't know what they're talking about. The argument comes from the fact that if you learn Japanese using anime, you will think, \"\u304a\u3044\u3001\u3066\u3081\u3047\u306a\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff01\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\" and \"\u3061\u3063\u3001\u30aa\u30e9\u3041\u4e00\u756a\u5f37\u3047\u3093\u3060\u305c\", \"\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\u4f55\u30d6\u30c4\u30d6\u30c4\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff1f\u6253\u3063\u6bba\u3059\u305e\uff01\" is natural. (Just imagine some very cringe and rude things if you cant read it haha) In actual fact, this is not true at all. It is important to remember that every anime is different, some speak more natural than others, some may sound more masculine than others, some may sound more feminine than others. For example, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" is more natural than \"Dragon Ball Z\". And \"Love Live!\" is more natural than \"Kill la Kill\". In anime such as \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Ren'ai Zunousen\", each character speaks different. Some characters speak like an \"anime\", while others actually sound pretty natural. Second, please take time to think: \"What is \"real\" Japanese?\" \"Real\" Japanese \u00b6 Anime is often argued to be not \"real\" Japanese. People arguing this only say this because it is different from the artificial, watered-down mess they learn in the textbooks. In fact, textbook Japanese is very unnatural, and can be argued that it is not \"real\" Japanese. There's many forms of Japanese. Just like how there are many forms of English. Do you speak in the same exact way as someone else you know? Probably not. But does this mean they are wrong and their English is not \"real\"? Absolutely not. Each person is unique to their own idiolects, different places have their own dialects, and so on. There are billions of different kinds of Japanese, so much so that it is not possible to point to a single form of Japanese and say that that one is the \"real\" Japanese. Anime in fact, is actually sometimes pretty natural, when I have conversations with Japanese friends what they say is close to what I've heard in anime before. Meanwhile, I have yet to experience Japanese people speaking sentences from textbooks. IN FACT... in Terrace House (the reality show with natural unscripted Japanese) they were making fun of textbook Japanese! So what exactly is real Japanese? \u00b6 Simple Answer. Japanese made by a NATIVE FOR NATIVES. Anime is scripted by natives. Movies are scripted by natives. J-Drama is scripted by natives. These content are made for Japanese people, and aren't necessarily intended for learning but surprisingly they are an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Textbooks, although they may be written by a native, they are made for foreigners. The Japanese gets watered down, artificial and filtered, for foreigners. That's why you shouldn't use content dumbed down for learners unless you are starting Japanese from scratch, in that case it is okay, but you should let go of it as soon as possible. Do not generalize Anime! \u00b6 It is annoying to constantly hear people saying that anime will make you always sound like you're about to kill someone, as demonstrated earlier. This is just people picking examples of anime that fit their argument, and completely disregarding the plethora of natural-talking anime that exist. Older anime sometimes have unusual, outdated slang, take for example, \"\u30c0\u30c1\" slang for a friend is pretty outdated by today and would sound funny if you said it to a Japanese person. Anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e yakuwarigo (role language), where the use of language is changed to fit how the character is like. For example, the anime villain may say \u8cb4\u69d8 kisama , or \u3066\u3081\u3047 a lot of the time, but anyone with a brain would know they shouldn't talk like that guy, so you won't end up saying it to a Japanese person. Because anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e, you will get a broad sense of immersion which means you would know what sounds masculine, what sounds feminine, arrogant, polite, sarcastic etc. Which makes it a very valuable immersion resource. Not every anime character sounds like Gokuu or Naruto or some other shounen MC, like I said, every anime is different, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" actually sounds pretty natural. Why you should learn from anime \u00b6 Widely available. There is a big community effort to make just about every anime available for free even on public trackers like Nyaa.si. No one is new to anime. You're learning Japanese, chances are anime was your motivation to start learning. Why not learn from the very thing that wanted to make you start learning the language? A wide sense of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e. This is essential. Close to real life speech, depending on what anime you watch. (e.g. Shinkai Makoto movies) Way better than boring textbooks, in terms of the actual Japanese and how much fun you're having too. PS: Your anime needs to have either Japanese subtitles or in entirely raw. People on Reddit may argue that people have watched anime for so long with English subtitles but still don't know Japanese, they're right. However, we don't use English subtitles, we watch raw or with Japanese subtitles at least.

The argument comes from the fact that if you learn Japanese using anime, you will think, \"\u304a\u3044\u3001\u3066\u3081\u3047\u306a\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff01\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\" and \"\u3061\u3063\u3001\u30aa\u30e9\u3041\u4e00\u756a\u5f37\u3047\u3093\u3060\u305c\", \"\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\u4f55\u30d6\u30c4\u30d6\u30c4\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff1f\u6253\u3063\u6bba\u3059\u305e\uff01\" is natural. (Just imagine some very cringe and rude things if you cant read it haha) In actual fact, this is not true at all. It is important to remember that every anime is different, some speak more natural than others, some may sound more masculine than others, some may sound more feminine than others. For example, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" is more natural than \"Dragon Ball Z\". And \"Love Live!\" is more natural than \"Kill la Kill\". In anime such as \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Ren'ai Zunousen\", each character speaks different. Some characters speak like an \"anime\", while others actually sound pretty natural. Second, please take time to think: \"What is \"real\" Japanese?\"","title":"Anime Japanese"},{"location":"animejp/#real-japanese","text":"Anime is often argued to be not \"real\" Japanese. People arguing this only say this because it is different from the artificial, watered-down mess they learn in the textbooks. In fact, textbook Japanese is very unnatural, and can be argued that it is not \"real\" Japanese. There's many forms of Japanese. Just like how there are many forms of English. Do you speak in the same exact way as someone else you know? Probably not. But does this mean they are wrong and their English is not \"real\"? Absolutely not. Each person is unique to their own idiolects, different places have their own dialects, and so on. There are billions of different kinds of Japanese, so much so that it is not possible to point to a single form of Japanese and say that that one is the \"real\" Japanese. Anime in fact, is actually sometimes pretty natural, when I have conversations with Japanese friends what they say is close to what I've heard in anime before. Meanwhile, I have yet to experience Japanese people speaking sentences from textbooks. IN FACT... in Terrace House (the reality show with natural unscripted Japanese) they were making fun of textbook Japanese!","title":"\"Real\" Japanese"},{"location":"animejp/#so-what-exactly-is-real-japanese","text":"Simple Answer. Japanese made by a NATIVE FOR NATIVES. Anime is scripted by natives. Movies are scripted by natives. J-Drama is scripted by natives. These content are made for Japanese people, and aren't necessarily intended for learning but surprisingly they are an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Textbooks, although they may be written by a native, they are made for foreigners. The Japanese gets watered down, artificial and filtered, for foreigners. That's why you shouldn't use content dumbed down for learners unless you are starting Japanese from scratch, in that case it is okay, but you should let go of it as soon as possible.","title":"So what exactly is real Japanese?"},{"location":"animejp/#do-not-generalize-anime","text":"It is annoying to constantly hear people saying that anime will make you always sound like you're about to kill someone, as demonstrated earlier. This is just people picking examples of anime that fit their argument, and completely disregarding the plethora of natural-talking anime that exist. Older anime sometimes have unusual, outdated slang, take for example, \"\u30c0\u30c1\" slang for a friend is pretty outdated by today and would sound funny if you said it to a Japanese person. Anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e yakuwarigo (role language), where the use of language is changed to fit how the character is like. For example, the anime villain may say \u8cb4\u69d8 kisama , or \u3066\u3081\u3047 a lot of the time, but anyone with a brain would know they shouldn't talk like that guy, so you won't end up saying it to a Japanese person. Because anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e, you will get a broad sense of immersion which means you would know what sounds masculine, what sounds feminine, arrogant, polite, sarcastic etc. Which makes it a very valuable immersion resource. Not every anime character sounds like Gokuu or Naruto or some other shounen MC, like I said, every anime is different, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" actually sounds pretty natural.","title":"Do not generalize Anime!"},{"location":"animejp/#why-you-should-learn-from-anime","text":"Widely available. There is a big community effort to make just about every anime available for free even on public trackers like Nyaa.si. No one is new to anime. You're learning Japanese, chances are anime was your motivation to start learning. Why not learn from the very thing that wanted to make you start learning the language? A wide sense of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e. This is essential. Close to real life speech, depending on what anime you watch. (e.g. Shinkai Makoto movies) Way better than boring textbooks, in terms of the actual Japanese and how much fun you're having too. PS: Your anime needs to have either Japanese subtitles or in entirely raw. People on Reddit may argue that people have watched anime for so long with English subtitles but still don't know Japanese, they're right. However, we don't use English subtitles, we watch raw or with Japanese subtitles at least.

This is probably the most complete Japanese FAQ you can find anywhere. Due to the FAQ becoming ridiculously long, it can be hard to quickly find what you want. In that case, use the search bar or Ctrl + F . Why this FAQ was made \u00b6 This FAQ aims to assist you with your self study. When it comes to learning Japanese, it is almost inevitable that you will often wonder about a lot of things. I\u2019m not going to always be here to help you out, so I might as well dump all my knowledge here. I am sure your question will be answered in this FAQ. If not, I'm willing to answer any question you have if you sub to my Patreon. Tango vs Core2.3k \u00b6 Why does TheMoeWay recommend the Tango deck in the main guide but Core2.3k in UsagiSpoon? The reason is not so simple, but the main guide and UsagiSpoon have different aims in mind. On the one hand, the main guide provides general guidelines on how to learn Japanese, but UsagiSpoon assumes you will follow everything written step by step. Why is this important? Well before I get into that, I would like to go through the main benefits and drawbacks of Tango vs Core2.3k. The cards in Tango are sentence cards, which means they show you full sentences for you to read and get the meaning from. The cards also re-use words already introduced before. This means that Tango is relatively easy. However, this also means Tango is less efficient, as not every new card is necessarily a new piece of information. On the other hand, in the Core2.3k deck, every other card is a new word. The information on the front of the card is the word on its own in kanji. This means that Core2.3k is more efficient, as every single new card is a new piece of information. However, this also makes Core2.3k very difficult. Now that that's out the way, the difference in recommendation is down to the purpose of the guide. UsagiSpoon was written with the intention of making a Japanese guide focused on efficiency. The use of early immersion, condensed audio, kanji cards, grammar study, vocab study, all in just 30 days also shows how UsagiSpoon tries to be efficient. I have received a lot of feedback on UsagiSpoon however, pointing out the difficulty of Core2.3k. I have also received feedback for the guide regarding the Tango decks, saying there are too many useless cards. Neither deck is perfect, whether you are following UsagiSpoon, or just following the main guide, feel free to use any vocab/sentence deck that you wish. How do I learn Japanese? \u00b6 Through massive amounts of input , in other words immersion. See the guide for more info. Can you teach me Japanese? \u00b6 No. I can\u2019t teach you Japanese. No one can. You need to learn it yourself. Read my guide to get started. Where can I find a Japanese language tutor? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need one. Why? Because you can self study. Anyone can self study. It is not as hard as you think. It will actually be easier since you can go at your own pace and study with what you like such as anime. I think tutors/teachers will slow you down. When will I be fluent? \u00b6 It heavily depends on your method ( how you are learning Japanese) and how long you spend learning Japanese per day. You say listen and read, but what should I listen to and read? \u00b6 Raw anime, untranslated manga, light novels and visual novels. Unsubbed J-drama, Unsubbed Japanese Movies. In other words\u2026 NATIVE CONTENT: CONTENT MADE BY NATIVES, FOR NATIVES Hey shoui, so I know the method you describe is better than what I\u2019m doing right now but can you please give me permission to carry on doing my own method? \u00b6 Don\u2019t care. It\u2019s your Japanese, not mine. When should I start using Anki? \u00b6 You can start to use Anki whenever you want actually, you can even learn the kana with it. However I recommend you start using Anki when you already have a grasp of the kana and basic grammar, after that you can download and start working on the Tango Anki decks. (Mining comes after) When (what time of day) should I do Anki? \u00b6 I recommend doing Anki the first thing in the morning. (As early as possible) How long should I spend on Anki? \u00b6 No more than 1 hour per day. Prioritise immersion time, not flashcards. They are only a supplement to your immersion. I spend about 25 minutes with Anki. And I study about 500 cards per day , Not anymore, I reset my Anki. Your format may vary the amount of time you spend. Personally I just use AnimeCards. About grammar, should I do Tae Kim or Cure Dolly? Pls answer \u00b6 Who cares. Just do whatever. (Cure Dolly is better in my humble opinion ;)) What JLPT are you shoui \u00b6 The JLPT is a dumb exam and it should never be used to measure Japanese ability. To answer your question: better than you. My JLPT N3 friend told me.... Blah blah blah blah \u00b6 Try to be more vigilant when it comes to taking advice from people. N3 is a pretty poor level. My JLPT N3 friend studied with a lot of textbooks and he is good! \u00b6 You don\u2019t know Japanese so you wouldn\u2019t know if he\u2019s good or not. He might as well be saying BS and due to your lack of Japanese knowledge you just take it as \u201cwow he\u2019s a genius\u201d, \u201cwow u know so much\u201d. This is known as the fluency illusion. Easiest anime/manga/light novel/visual novel? \u00b6 Mitsuboshi Colors/Yotsubato!/GJ bu/Hanahira this may be inaccurate, but usually what the average DJT'er will consoom. How to study kanji? \u00b6 By reading. Just read, look up words. If you can read the words in their kanji in this sentence: \u305d\u3057\u3066\u8d77\u6b7b\u56de\u751f\u306e\u9583\u304d\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u306e\u306f\u552f\u6211\u90e8\u9577\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002then you \u201cknow\u201d the kanji. If you look up the words and then remember them then you'll know more kanji, well done. How much kanji are used in Japanese? \u00b6 The \u5e38\u7528 (Jouyou, kanji required to be taught in the Japanese school curriculum) kanji list has 2136 kanji. But don\u2019t let this fool you. Approximately 3000 kanji are used in Japanese, outside of newspapers and JLPT/learner oriented material. Don\u2019t worry too much about how much kanji are used in Japanese. I literally only think about how much kanji are used when I write guides and FAQs such as this one, it\u2019s pretty irrelevant. You should just read. How do I look up words easier on webpages? \u00b6 Yomichan. You can find it on the Chrome Web Store or whatever Firefox uses. Load dictionaries into it and hover over text while holding the Shift key. I went into more detail in Yomichan Guide , so check that out. How do I look up words easier in manga? \u00b6 KanjiTomo. Just hover your mouse over the word. Works 90% of the time. If not then just write the word in Google Translate, there\u2019s a handwriting feature for Japanese. It will recognise what you wrote no matter how sloppy you wrote it, it\u2019s honestly great. - the detection, not the translation! After that look up the word in a dictionary. How do I look up words? \u00b6 Using yomichan. How to learn Japanese slang monolingually? Most J-J dictionaries don\u2019t have slang \u00b6 Using my yomichan dictionaries. Is it useful learning kanji radicals? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need them but if kanji still look like scribbles to you after months of reading, then you might want to search \u201cKangXi Radicals\u201d on Google and just look at them, hopefully that will help. I have extreme difficulty remembering a certain word/kanji (outside of SRS) \u00b6 Read more. Listen more. You don\u2019t need to believe me if you don\u2019t want to but you will eventually remember it with more immersion. I kept on forgetting \u8778\u725b[\u304b\u305f\u3064\u3080\u308a] no matter how much times I looked it up, or so I thought. After about my 80th look-up I was able to remember it. So yeah. Or you could make an Anki card for it\u2026 I am trying to learn grammar but I keep on forgetting the grammar points and I don\u2019t understand the grammar points. \u00b6 Try to rethink your approach to grammar. You need to immerse while following a grammar guide. Recommended grammar guides are Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. You can find these in Resources . Listen more. Read more. Is remembering the kanji form of words usually written in kana useful? For example \u849f\u84bb is the kanji form of \u30b3\u30f3\u30cb\u30e3\u30af \u00b6 Yes. Best dictionary for first-time monolingual users? \u00b6 There is no single dictionary I can point to and say it's the best. Every dictionary has their weak points and strong points. Use every dictionary together. If you\u2019re interested in my order of dictionaries in Yomichan, you can find that at Monolingual Guide I don\u2019t understand this sentence even though I know all the words. \u00b6 Just forget about it for now. Listen more. Read more. It will come to you soon. When I\u2019m listening I don\u2019t understand but when I looked at the subtitles/transcript I actually knew the words, why is this? \u00b6 You need to listen more. Stop using subtitles. When I\u2019m reading I don\u2019t understand, and I even looked up the words\u2026 \u00b6 Read more. Increase reading speed??? \u00b6 Read more. Can I use Japanese music to learn Japanese? \u00b6 By just listening to it? No. What you can do is look at the lyric sheet and look up the words. But they don\u2019t speak like real life in anime though? \u00b6 anime japanese I am going to immerse with J-drama instead because they don\u2019t talk real life in anime. \u00b6 Cool. it depends on the j-drama though, if it is unrealistic fiction (e.g. Ikebukuro West Gate Park) then it will be as unnatural as anime, if it's realistic fiction (e.g. Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu) then it will be pretty close to real life Japanese. I want to be able to understand anime without subtitles, will your guide work? \u00b6 Yes. I want to be able to speak with natives naturally, will your guide work? \u00b6 Yes. How long should I immerse per day? \u00b6 As much as you can. The more Japanese you do, the more gains you get. This method seems too hardcore for me\u2026 \u00b6 That\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t need to do it if you don\u2019t want to. It's your loss though... Why do you make it seem like your method is the only way to learn Japanese? \u00b6 I don\u2019t. That\u2019s just what you\u2019re thinking. The method I talk about is just more effective than more widely spread methods. Please prove me wrong. I won\u2019t change my argument until you can convince me otherwise. I believe most widespread methods don\u2019t help people achieve, nor give proper pointers on how to achieve the one thing everyone wants to achieve: fluency. How many people have said, \u201cI want to watch anime without subtitles xD\u201d? Countless amounts of people. Regular textbook and early output based methods do not help learners watch anime without subtitles no matter how many years they study. The method I talk about does. You learn with anime. You learn with what made you want to learn in the first place. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s the \u201cbest method\u201d. shoui what\u2019s your immersion setup? \u00b6 Laptop and video player When is hiragana, katakana and kanji used? \u00b6 Go learn with immersion. Please note that the usages of these are not consistent. So I can\u2019t really say for sure. Hiragana is used for words not written in kanji (such as \u3053\u3068 which also has a kanji form \u4e8b), whatever sticks out at the end of a verb (e.g. \u5473\u308f\u3046, \u639b\u3051\u308b. \u602f\u3080), things like \u201c\u3060\u308d\u3046, \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u201d, particles (such as \u3092\u3001\u306e\u3001\u306f\u3001\u306b\u3001\u304c\u3001\u3067 etc.), someone's name (like \u3086\u307f, this can also be in kanji too because like I said it\u2019s not consistent). Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (communication from English), \u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3 (R\u00f6ntgen from German), \u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8 (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e ( giongo , onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like \u3042\u3063\u3055\u308a are almost always in hiragana, things like \u30b4\u30ef\u30b4\u30ef are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used. I recommend you just learn the usages through immersion. I have a picture in the guide about these writing systems too by the way. Why is WaniKani bad? \u00b6 It forces you to go in a specific order and at a specific pace. The SRS is poor and offers no customisation. You don\u2019t learn with compelling content, instead you learn with whatever watered-down JSL stuff they throw in front of you. And it\u2019s paid. Why would you pay to learn Japanese? It isn't a paid endeavour. I haven\u2019t spent a penny on Japanese. It's a glorified textbook. They put you through an RTK-style tedious 2000 kanji learning process, only that they add readings to it, I guess the people over at Tofugu didn't realise learning readings in isolation is pretty much useless. Learning is simple as it is. Don\u2019t fall for pretty-UI learning programs such as WaniKani, they just want your money when in fact they are just selling a low quality product. Fluentcards/Videobook looks bad. Please help. \u00b6 Animebook. UPDATE: You can use MPV instead How many words do I need to know to understand EVERYTHING? \u00b6 Around 30k. You may think, but uh with 2k I can understand 80%? Yeah but it gets very steep after that. 10k is around 98%, 20k is around 99% and 30k is like 99.9% because I can\u2019t guarantee that you can understand 100% with 30k. But it is definitely a good number to aim for. I don't understand everything in English so is it really worth the endeavour? That is your decision. Why are Core decks bad? Should I do Core decks? \u00b6 They aren't bad... it's just... The frequency lists the Core decks are based on are very low quality. So you aren\u2019t even learning \u201ccore\u201d words. It is also much more difficult than Tango. HUH? NO FURIGANA? THAT\u2019S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THEN!!! \u00b6 Furigana has never been necessary and relying on it only holds you back becoming able to read fluently. You should learn how to function without it. In my opinion furigana is pretty useless apart from when it's on names. What\u2019s better Tango N5+N4 or Core2k/3k? \u00b6 Doesn\u2019t matter as long as you get onto mining straight after you completed them. I don\u2019t have that green + button like you do in Yomichan \u00b6 Setup AnkiConnect. https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/ Make sure you also have a proper card type and have filled in the fields correctly. Should I follow JLPT lists? \u00b6 No, the JLPT is very restrictive. Just learn what you come across in your immersion. Are you learning Japanese to pass an exam lmfao? I'm not ready for watching anime or anything without subtitles yet... that's for like, advanced learners like JLP\u30fc NO. \u00b6 Wrong. It\u2019s never too early to watch anime without subtitles. You need to watch anime without subtitles to get good at it anyway. Reddit \u00b6 If you wish to make actual gains in Japanese, I suggest you stop using Reddit completely. I don\u2019t have time to learn Japanese \u00b6 You may have more time than you think you do to learn Japanese. Stop playing video games. Stop going on Reddit. Wake up early. Do your Anki reps in the morning. Stop talking on Discord. Stop consuming content in English. Or if you really don\u2019t have any time and it isn\u2019t just you saying \u201cI\u2019d rather spend my time doing other things.\u201d then just try to squeeze in even the smallest amount of Japanese into your day, it won\u2019t be much but \u201cbarely any Japanese\u201d is better than \u201cno Japanese\u201d I am immersing late at night, is this bad? \u00b6 It is bad. Please don\u2019t immerse when you\u2019re supposed to be sleeping, you\u2019re only reducing your immersion quality. I'm hearing the ga sound but it sounds like nga or something? \u00b6 \u9f3b\u6fc1\u97f3 I am actively immersing, you say just pay attention to what they\u2019re saying, can you go into more detail? \u00b6 It depends on your comprehension I guess. If you\u2019re below 40%, just listen out for what words you can pickout, try to guess the meaning of phrases, try to like, listen to the sounds. When you\u2019re at like 80% comprehension, pay attention to the plot of the anime and try to just get the meaning of sentences but not necessarily how it was said specifically e.g. what form a verb was in. For example if you came across the sentence \u4ffa\u3092\u8ab0\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b, you would know the message the sentence is trying to send but you wouldn\u2019t pay attention to the particle \u3092 being used because you don\u2019t need to to understand the overall meaning of the sentence. When you get about 90%+ comprehension, pay attention to the form; how the sentence is expressed, before you may not have payed attention to the \u306b\u306f in \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u306f\u95a2\u4fc2\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 but now you should. Also pay attention to what specific words are used to express specific ideas in specific situations. Will re-watching shows I have already immersed with be useful? \u00b6 Yes but once you get bored, switch! Can I get fluent with only 1 hour of immersion? \u00b6 No. It will take you 10 years to even get close. Is Genki worth it? \u00b6 In my humble opinion, no. Genki is not worth your time. Genki is inferior to the free resources I\u2019m giving you such as Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. Genki is also not meant to be used for self study, it needs at least 2 people and 1 Japanese teacher in the room. You need someone who knows what they\u2019re doing (e.g. a Japanese teacher) in the room because if you just do it alone you will be heavily misguided. Ridiculous. I also think Genki explains things poorly, they basically teach English but force Japanese into it. Should I do RTK (Remembering the Kanji)? \u00b6 If you find kanji to be scribbles after months of reading then sure. Can you tell me what this kanji is? \u00b6 Just write it in Google Translate handwriting feature, it will detect it no matter how sloppy you wrote it. Then copy it into a dictionary such as jisho.org and then you\u2019ll get your answer. I can\u2019t read kanji yet\u2026 \u00b6 I absolutely hate it when people say \u201cI can\u2019t read kanji\u201d. People that say this have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. You mean, \u201cwords\u201d; you can\u2019t \u201cread the words\u201d? If you mean that then just look up the words then. If you can\u2019t read this sentence \u201c\u7206\u767a\u304c\u8d77\u3053\u3063\u305f\u5239\u90a3\u201d, then don't say, \u201cI can\u2019t read the kanji\u201d, say \u201cI can\u2019t read the words\u201d. If you can\u2019t \u201cread kanji\u201d then learn how to; by learning how to read. That\u2019s just it, just learn how to read. How do I learn how to read? \u00b6 By looking up the words. Look at the Japanese sentence I gave above. Chances are you don\u2019t know \u5239\u90a3. Copy it into a dictionary or use Yomichan, it will show you the reading (\u305b\u3064\u306a) and the meaning (\u304d\u308f\u3081\u3066\u77ed\u3044\u6642\u9593)(if you are learning it bilingually it might be moment; instant). Congratulations you now know how to read more Japanese. JLPT Grammar \u00b6 It's important to learn it. How do you learn how to write Japanese? \u00b6 Before you do this, try to think if learning how to write Japanese is even useful or not. For most people, not so much, but if you want to live in Japan you will probably need to depend on writing Japanese. To others it may just be a passion learning how to write kanji. In this day and age you can just type Japanese on a computer or on your phone, so it is not essential. Now to learn how to write: Just write a lot. Make sure you have a good setup. Here\u2019s what I recommend: Genkouyoushi Paper (you can also use notebooks that have Genkouyoushi Paper) and Sarasa Clip pen. Just practice writing while looking at the stroke order for characters. Repetition. There\u2019s no hack to get around it. You may have thought, \u201cRTK\u201d, but you are still doing repetition with RTK. It's been a few months of learning. Why does it feel like nothing is clicking? \u00b6 I think you need to up your active immersion. Make sure you are grading your Anki cards correctly. Make sure you are ACTIVELY immersing, not passive, ACTIVE immersion. Maybe you should go over Cure Dolly/Tae Kim again. If it\u2019s been a few months learning then learn how to read manga, I think all of this will really help you. If you feel demotivated try to watch the first thing you immersed with, so you can see how much more you can understand now versus when you first watched it. Look at your Anki stats, so you can see how much you have actually learned. I don't understand anything when immersing. Why is that? How long will it take for me to understand what I'm listening to?** \u00b6 That\u2019s cause you haven\u2019t listened and read enough. Try looking up words you hear clearly enough. It will only take a few months of listening+looking up+japanese subtitles+anki to understand 80% of your immersion. That 20% is still the actual important details so you will still have a long way to go tho. Hang in there. I'm trying to translate Japanese into English while immersing. Is this wrong? \u00b6 Yes. But as a beginner it is hard to not translate to English. Try to use your willpower to try and not translate, overtime it will just go away and you will understand and think about Japanese you hear, in Japanese. How often should I study and for how long? \u00b6 Try to study everyday, so it will eventually become a habit. I don\u2019t even need to think to open up Anki, click my deck and then click \u201cStudy Now\u201d. It\u2019s all inertia to me. Try to study as long as you can. If you have free time, try to use it for Japanese. What are the requirements for reading Japanese? How long will it take for me to get there? \u00b6 Like legit reading manga and books? You can start reading Japanese after some listening immersion. How much? Let\u2019s just say, 6 hours everyday for a month. Around 180 hours? Around 40 12 episode anime? Or maybe even less? After that you can get into reading. At what point do you begin learning how to read kanji? \u00b6 See above. What is good immersion material for beginners? \u00b6 Most anime. Pretty much every slice of life anime. But don\u2019t restrict yourself to just slice of life anime. Some things are surprisingly incredibly good for beginners such as Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer). Just find what interests you. You just need to immerse with whatever interests you because that makes it fun. I have no idea how to start making decks and memorizing kanji. What do I do? \u00b6 Making decks - Just follow the animecards.site guide. Memorizing kanji - Just do reading practice, and make cards if you wish. How does you mine, shoui? \u00b6 https://www.animecards.site How many new cards per day? \u00b6 Just do 10. If you feel like it is too less, do 15 or 20. Please bear in mind that the more new cards you do, the more reviews you\u2019ll get. Mining Mentality: When to mine (add to Anki) or just to look up and carry on? \u00b6 Hey look, I\u2019m not even gonna go into this because I think if you just do what I do, you won\u2019t worry about things like this. Here\u2019s what I do. The only things I mine are from anime I have already seen, or from books I\u2019ve already read. The point is that if you\u2019re looking up, you will remember about maybe half of what you looked up, I can\u2019t say for sure though. So you go back to the content you just watched/read and mine whatever you didn\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve been doing this for nearly 6 months and it has worked great for me, and I think it will do for you too. EDIT 2021 uhh I just mine everything when i see it now no matter how ridiculous it is How many cards do you make per day? \u00b6 One anime episode worth of cards per day. I mine anime I have already watched. When I run out of new cards I mine another episode to stock up on more cards to learn. I also mine books I\u2019ve already read. I add 20 cards to review for the next day. When is Kun-yomi and On-yomi used? \u00b6 Wait, wait, wait. Stop right there. Get everything you know about kanji out of your head because it\u2019s probably horribly misguided. Done? Good. Forget Kun and On and just read. I\u2019ve never worried about these On\u2019s and Kun\u2019s in my entire life. It\u2019s ridiculous and almost sad seeing people struggle because they have such a terrible misunderstanding of it. Learn words, then you will know all these On\u2019s and Kun\u2019s. Just read and remember words how they are, for example in this sentence: \u201c\u9020\u5316\u306e\u5de7\u307f\u201d, look up the words and remember them. Screw On and Kun why is there even the distinction, it just confuses you. Yes I know in the sentence the first word is \u201conyomi\u201d and the second is \u201ckunyomi\u201d but who cares? The problem is people get into such a conundrum over \"kun vs on\" due to poor explanation and communication from classes, textbooks and Japanese learning courses. It is honestly very sad. Next question. Are mnemonics for kana, kanji and words and such good? \u00b6 No. W-what should I do when I come across a kanji I don\u2019t know? \u00b6 You mean a WORD you don\u2019t know?? Look it up. If you don\u2019t remember it then that\u2019s ok. Chances are you will see it in your immersion again, and that will be your chance to remember it What should I do when I come across a word I don\u2019t know (in reading)? \u00b6 See above. This is a better worded question than above. What should I do when I come across a word I don\u2019t know (in listening)? \u00b6 It largely depends on how many words in the sentence you don\u2019t know. If it has 2 words you don\u2019t know, you can choose to look up one of the words. If it has 1 word you don\u2019t know, definitely look it up. - This is a \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d. If any more than 2 words, don\u2019t look up if you want to guarantee you remember them. But can't I learn Japanese by focusing on the audio while using the English subs as a guide? \u00b6 No. What if I can't find anything I enjoy immersing with? \u00b6 keep on looking Can I use romanji? \u00b6 First of all, it\u2019s romaji not romanji. And second, no. Don\u2019t use romaji. Learn the kana as quickly as you can. Kana or Romaji input method (IME)? \u00b6 For your PC, definitely romaji input. For your phone, then kana input. No questions asked. Should I use Japanese subs? \u00b6 I might have already answered this but\u2026 not always. Only in the beginning. Split your time up between watching raw and in Japanese subs. The reason you need to watch raw is so you get the best accent in the end and also because using subs all the time means you won't really be training your listening ability at all. How much should I balance my listening and reading? \u00b6 I think, when you\u2019re at the stage where you can go on to reading without messing up your accent, you should read more than you listen. Why is this? Well, reading is probably the best way I currently know of to increase your vocabulary. These new vocabulary you acquired can easily transfer to your listening. Most of my vocabulary is what I learned from reading. There\u2019s about a 90% chance you will hear these new words in the next anime you watch. It happens every time. Learned \u6ed1\u7a3d from reading one day, heard it in the anime I watched the next. I cannot think of any exception. Reading is a powerful tool. But don\u2019t slack on the listening! That\u2019s still very important. But, I can admit that reading for long hours is harder than listening for long hours so even if your reading hours are a little shorter than your listening hours (e.g. 4 listening hours 2.5 reading hours), you are still making some serious gains. Don\u2019t see this as an excuse to slack reading though. Should I study other languages along with Japanese? \u00b6 If you don\u2019t want to get remotely good at any of the languages, then ok. But if you want to get good at Japanese, then don\u2019t study any other languages while studying Japanese. I am learning Japanese with (n) textbook, is it bad? \u00b6 Yes. Please follow the Japanese Guide and reconsider your approach to learning. Is X textbook better than Y textbook? \u00b6 Both bad. Follow my guide. Pitch Accent? \u00b6 Learn the basics of pitch accent, either from Dogen's course or the NHK Accent Dictionary so that you can learn how to hear it in your input, so you can acquire it naturally. I don\u2019t want to believe anything you\u2019re saying and I would rather stick with what I\u2019m doing if that\u2019s okay with you? \u00b6 Ok Where to find anime for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Check out nyaa.si, anime-raws list, Crunchyroll and animelon in Resources If you have money check out Netflix. Crunchyroll is free but with ads. You can turn off subs on desktop but not on mobile. I\u2019ve heard VRV works but it\u2019s blocked in my region \\;( Where to find j-drama for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Check out nyaa.si, rakuten viki, the j-drama google drive folder in the Resources . Chinese streaming sites seem to also have a lot of Chinese sub j-dramas, so you can use them if you can\u2019t speak/read Chinese. If you have money check out Netflix and Hulu JP. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be on AvistaZ private tracker then you have access to just about any J-drama you like. If you ask me (shoui) nicely I can find something on AvistaZ for you. I won't. My ratio on AvistaZ is ass right now and I don't want to download stuff I'm not going to watch Where to find manga for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Check out nyaa.si and itazuraneko in If you have money you can buy digital manga from Amazon JP. Where to find light novels for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Itazuraneko. If you have money you can buy digital light novels from Amazon JP. Where to find visual novels for learning Japanese? \u00b6 (listed in Resources ) itazuraneko, nblog, ryuublogger, (sukebei)nyaa.si. If you have money you can buy visual novels from Steam. If you are lucky enough to be on AnimeBytes private tracker then you have access to just about any visual novel you like. If you ask me (shoui) nicely I can find something on AnimeBytes for you. No seriously, I will. Just make sure it isn't already on the free resources available to you. How to text-hook visual novels? \u00b6 vn guide How do I switch from traditional methods to your method? \u00b6 You probably have a stupid flashcard deck on some SRS that probably isn\u2019t Anki. Even if you used Anki you were probably using some stupid pre-made deck. You are halfway through your second Genki textbook or whatever. You paid for Memrise Premium. You have a WaniKani subscription. LingoDeer lured you into buying their premium too. What should you do? Screw them. Cancel your premium subscriptions. Learning Japanese is completely FREE and I can guarantee you that. Delete your old stupid decks. You may worry that you may forget everything you\u2019ve learned, but you won\u2019t. You won\u2019t forget everything. Stop using the textbook, return it or something. You may also have HelloTalk friends. Well let me tell you the truth about HelloTalk friends: they don't even care about you. They just want to practice English with you, not Japanese. If you ask them to correct you they will probably block you, so they\u2019re just stopping any chance of you ever improving. So forget about them, why even bother? Speaking practice doesn't really mean much without immersion anyway. Now, it may be different what you gotta do depending on how good you are. If you haven\u2019t gotten that far (e.g. can\u2019t understand like 50% of anime yet) then just follow the Japanese Guide from the beginning, if you already know kana, you don\u2019t need to re-learn them. Watch the Cure Dolly grammar guide. Setup Anki, import the Tango N4+N5/Core3k decks and work through them. Immerse everyday. If you\u2019re a so-called \u201cintermediate\u201d then just get to mining with AnimeCards straight away. Immerse everyday. There is no way you got to an \u201cadvanced\u201d level or even close using a bad method so I\u2019ll end this here. How to deal with words with multiple meanings? \u00b6 The answer is simple. You already know you should learn words in context and in sentences. The context+sentence is almost always enough for you to get which definition fits. If not, try a monolingual dictionary. I came across \u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u5439\u3063\u639b\u3051\u308b, \u5439\u3063\u639b\u3051\u308b has 3 definitions listed in the Daijirin. The second one had the same example \u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u2014 so I was able to figure it out. \uff08\uff12\uff09\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u56f0\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3057\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3002\u300c\u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u2015\u30fb\u3051\u308b\u300d\u300c\u8b70\u8ad6\u3092\u2015\u30fb\u3051\u308b\u300d. If you can\u2019t figure it out then just learn whatever. If you come across a usage of a word different to the one you learned, you don\u2019t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage. How to deal with words with multiple readings? \u00b6 If it has furigana on top, learn it with that reading. If it\u2019s from anime, learn it with the reading they pronounce it with. If there is no furigana and audio then try using https://furigana.info/ , search for the word and it will show you the readings in order of commonness. If you can\u2019t find out, then just learn whatever. If you come across a kana usage different to the one you learned, you don\u2019t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage. So the JLPT is sh/t, so what \u201clevel\u201d are each of the N\u2019s? \u00b6 Cant even say because a jlpt cert cannot, will not and does not gauge japanese ability Is it bad if I make a mistake when speaking? \u00b6 No. As long as you are immersing everyday, don't worry about it! Is it bad? It depends how you see it. If you care what Japanese people may think, then it is not bad at all. Japanese people are very nice and kind and don't really care if you can't speak Japanese good. If you want your Japanese to be natural and \"good\", then you still don't need to worry about making mistakes, because making mistakes is not a problem as long as you are immersing everyday. I can understand my immersion but I\u2019m not fluent, what should I do? \u00b6 You need more immersion. Pay attention to what they\u2019re saying. This is literally what I struggle with by the way, but you literally just need more immersion and you\u2019ll get good, believe me \u306f vs \u304c \u00b6 They are completely different. Cure Dolly has a good explanation of this, start with her first video. The first step to understanding the difference is not associating them with each other. And then immerse to deepen your understanding Can I get by with just kana? Kanji is too hard. \u00b6 no Thoughts on immersing while sleeping? \u00b6 It's BS. Thoughts on kanji study apps? \u00b6 No. JUST READ!!!!!!!!! Will speaking a lot make me good? \u00b6 No. Then how do you get good? \u00b6 Through input. Primarily listening for learning how to speak naturally and reading for increasing your vocabulary. Speaking is not learning. Listening and reading is learning. You are not learning anything when you\u2019re not immersing. Speaking is just the icing on the cake. Should I pronounce out loud new words? \u00b6 No, I don't recommend it. You can get by just by reading it in your head. Should I read out loud the sentence in my sentence cards? \u00b6 Nah you don't need to. Absolutely fine if you just read it in your head. Thoughts on passive immersion? \u00b6 It depends. If you can\u2019t understand like 90% of your immersion yet then it won't get you gains. If you understand over 90% then you can make gains when you listen in on it every now and then, but much less efficient than active immersion overall. Thoughts on Duolingo, Busuu, LingoDeer, Memrise, Drops and other similar apps \u00b6 Don\u2019t even bother LMAO. Follow my guide for some real Japanese gains Link These two words have the same meaning!! \u00b6 They have the same English meaning. English is not the best language to express Japanese. Japanese is the best language to express Japanese. You need to use a J-J dictionary such as the \u5927\u8f9e\u6797 to find out the difference. If you\u2019re not good enough to read a J-J definition yet then don\u2019t worry about it because you can also find out the difference through immersion. Grading monolingual cards \u00b6 Ah, this one is a classic. You just need to remember the gist of the definition. It is hard at first but you get better at it. If I put this in my SRS: \u304d\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3064 [0]\u3010\u6050\u559d\u3011 \u2015\u3059\u308b \u76f8\u624b\u306e\u5f31\u307f\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3064\u3051\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u304a\u3069\u3057\u3064\u3051\u3001\u304a\u91d1\u3084\u54c1\u7269\u3092\u51fa\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002 \u300c\u2015\u7f6a[4]\u300d the gist I remember would be \u5f31\u3044\u76f8\u624b \u304a\u3069\u3057\u3064\u3051\u308b \u304a\u91d1\u306a\u3069 \u51fa\u3055\u305b\u308b , or something along those lines. If I put this in my SRS: \u305d\u3046-\u3060\u3064 \u30b5\u30a6\u2015 [0] \u3010\u4e89\u596a\u3011 \uff08\u540d\uff09\u30b9\u30eb \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u596a\u3044\u5408\u3044\u4e89\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3002\u300c\u5929\u7687\u676f\u306e\u2015\u6226\u300d the gist I remember would be \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3059\u308b \u596a\u3044\u5408\u3044 , that would be enough to get the word. You\u2019re probably confused but trust me it is tricky at the beginning but overtime you get good at it. Grading sentence cards \u00b6 If you\u2019re doing sentence cards then I\u2019ll talk you through the review process. Let's think back to bilingual cards, how do you grade them? You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence. It\u2019s basically the same for monolingual cards. How to grade Tango cards? \u00b6 You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence. Why do you do AnimeCards over sentence cards? \u00b6 Muh opinion I want to pass the JLPT N1. How long will that take me with your method? \u00b6 Cant say as it all depends on how much you immerse Also make sure you study the grammar used in JLPT N1 (it is easy to look over them in immersion) I don\u2019t want to use Anki. Is that fine? \u00b6 Uh, there is no doubt that your progress will be inevitably slower than someone that does the exact same as you but uses Anki. I don\u2019t think any amount of reading can circumvent using the SRS. If you hate using Anki, then try to use a different format. AnimeCards are quick and simple to make and review. I recommend them. I think you can still get very good without using Anki but think of it like this: the SRS shaves a good year off the amount of time it takes to get fluent ;) Of course, SRS doesn\u2019t make you fluent, immersion does, but SRS is a supplement to your immersion. SRS makes your immersion more comprehensible, so you make the most gains. How about using an all Japanese textbook such as \u201cMinna no Nihongo\u201d? \u00b6 Don\u2019t use Minna no nihongo lmao. If you\u2019re asking this question you probably have a misunderstanding on how you learn grammar as a beginner. Your goal isn\u2019t to learn grammar. Your goal is to acquire grammar. There is a limit to how much you can understand Japanese grammar even when it is explained to you when you haven\u2019t acquired it yet. If I read Tae Kim I can see it in completely different eyes to what a beginner sees it in. Reading a guide written in English won\u2019t have much of a difference than reading a guide written in (watered down) Japanese, because you\u2019re a beginner. So you just need to read Tae Kim/watch Cure Dolly and then immerse to acquire grammar. I studied Japanese grammar after I acquired it, not before. And I used resources for natives such as \u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178\u2019s. It\u2019s just to give myself a metaunderstanding of the grammar I have already naturally acquired. I can do this with English too, but I don\u2019t care enough to find out so.. Eh. Hey shoui I found (x) Japanese course, is it good? \u00b6 If I haven\u2019t talked about it yet then probably no because I don\u2019t want to talk about silly courses like JapanesePod101, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, Assimil. All which have been proved to be utter ass. There is a good reason why I haven\u2019t talked about it yet. When should I put my PC/phone in Japanese? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need to but it definitely helps. Do it when you\u2019re used to reading I guess. Is (x) anime good for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Yes. I only want to sentence mine from anime, is this fine? \u00b6 Yeah. I only want to sentence mine from books, is this fine? \u00b6 Yeah. Is learning how to understand dialects like Kansai-ben difficult? \u00b6 No. The Intermediate Blues \u00b6 (Intermediate= >N1) The Intermediate Blues. The Intermediate Plateau. Whatever you want to call it. This is the feeling of not feeling like you are improving, despite doing 40 Anki cards per day, speeding through your reviews, reading for 3 hours, listening for 6 hours. In fact, there is no plateau. It doesn\u2019t exist. You are either improving (when u immerse) or getting worse (when u dont immerse). The Intermediate Blues are usually felt when you remember back when you were a beginner and you could feel your progress everyday, you don\u2019t really get that same feeling as an intermediate learner. You are improving. Please note that you can understand like 80% of your immersion with like 2000 words. You can understand like 90% with 10,000. It just gets very steep. 20,000 you understand like 95%. 30,000 you may finally be close to the 100%. The feeling sucks, but you gotta keep going. What usually motivates is when I hear in an anime a word I learned the day before, it always gives me a motivation boost no matter what Should I put Japanese names into Anki? \u00b6 Yeah whatever, do it if you want to learn how to read Japanese names like in anime credits or something, otherwise I don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s still a pretty neat skill to have though. \u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b You have reached the end of the FAQ!

The reason is not so simple, but the main guide and UsagiSpoon have different aims in mind. On the one hand, the main guide provides general guidelines on how to learn Japanese, but UsagiSpoon assumes you will follow everything written step by step. Why is this important? Well before I get into that, I would like to go through the main benefits and drawbacks of Tango vs Core2.3k. The cards in Tango are sentence cards, which means they show you full sentences for you to read and get the meaning from. The cards also re-use words already introduced before. This means that Tango is relatively easy. However, this also means Tango is less efficient, as not every new card is necessarily a new piece of information. On the other hand, in the Core2.3k deck, every other card is a new word. The information on the front of the card is the word on its own in kanji. This means that Core2.3k is more efficient, as every single new card is a new piece of information. However, this also makes Core2.3k very difficult. Now that that's out the way, the difference in recommendation is down to the purpose of the guide. UsagiSpoon was written with the intention of making a Japanese guide focused on efficiency. The use of early immersion, condensed audio, kanji cards, grammar study, vocab study, all in just 30 days also shows how UsagiSpoon tries to be efficient. I have received a lot of feedback on UsagiSpoon however, pointing out the difficulty of Core2.3k. I have also received feedback for the guide regarding the Tango decks, saying there are too many useless cards. Neither deck is perfect, whether you are following UsagiSpoon, or just following the main guide, feel free to use any vocab/sentence deck that you wish.","title":"Tango vs Core2.3k"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-learn-japanese","text":"Through massive amounts of input , in other words immersion.

A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used.

But language learning is something you do in the long term, so please take time to read this guide in its entirety. New: 30 day routine to learn Japanese from scratch: UsagiSpoon Why many people \u201cfail\u201d to learn Japanese \u00b6 Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by \u201cfail\u201d. What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don\u2019t ever reach this goal, or even get close. I believe it mostly isn\u2019t their fault, but rather, the method \u2019s fault. Whether you\u2019re a \u201cvisual learner\u201d or an \u201cauditory learner\u201d does not mean anything when it comes to learning a language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language by hearing it (like we all did) but apparently you\u2019re more of a \u201cvisual learner.\u201d It mostly comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I believe the method in the first place is very important. For example, if someone told you that you could learn to swim by reading a book about swimming, would you be able to swim after you finished that book? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method - it does not work. What this guide aims to do is educate you on effective methods to study Japanese, so that you don\u2019t end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all while having fun in your target language, and in this case, your target language is most likely Japanese. Back to the \u201cvisual learner\u201d and \u201cauditory learner\u201d thing, while it may be true for other fields of study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all acquire language in the same exact way, and that is through comprehensible input . I often come across people saying, \u201ceveryone learns differently\u201d and again, this may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition . Key word: acquisition. Learning vs. Acquisition \u00b6 Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to what one experiences in school. The individual is given \u201cgrammar rules\u201d and/or a \u201cvocabulary list\u201d to remember. When it comes to communicating in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and try to use that to speak the language. According to Stephen Krashen, the leading linguist in language acquisition, this is less effective than acquisition. Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious process of which individuals need not be aware. What this actually means is, this process is fundamentally the same for everyone, hence natural and acquired pieces of language can be utilized intuitively , where the individual, in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition process may not feel like \u201clanguage learning\u201d and when new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. Acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than form. What this means is, one is not concerned with the form of the language they are hearing and/or their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. \u203b \u201cLearning Japanese\u201d may improperly refer to both acquiring and learning. So please keep that in mind. i+1 \u00b6 From Wikipedia: \u201c[The Input Hypothesis] states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input \u201ci+1\u201d, where \u201ci\u201d is the learner\u2019s interlanguage and \u201c+1\u2033 is the next stage of language acquisition.\u201d In simple terms, i+1 means \u201cone [and no more than one] thing [piece of language] you do not yet know in the sentence\" Say if you were learning English and you heard the sentence, \"I'm playing the guitar\", but you didn't know the word \"playing\" . This sentence would be i+1 because you know all the words and grammar structures apart from \"playing\". This is also comprehensible input IF you understood the message it was conveying. i+1 is important because the highest level of acquisition gains are obtained at this level. Input & Comprehensible Input \u00b6 Input itself refers to listening and reading to native content in the target language. Mass input can be referred to as immersion . Native content means content made by natives, for natives. (Raw) Anime is made by natives, for natives, therefore it is native content. Comprehensible input refers to input where messages are conveyed and understood. It is the most crucial ingredient in the acquisition of language. Any input is not sufficient for acquisition, the input must be comprehensible . However, as a beginner, it may seem difficult to find comprehensible input, and that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from incomprehensible input , too, but not in the same way. Language is not acquired from incomprehensible input but from comprehensible input. So please keep that in mind. It is also important to keep in mind that talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people give anecdotes of how they got better at a language by speaking a lot, they do not realise that it was the input (from the partner) which improved their skill at the language. Speaking (output) is just the icing on the cake, and input is where you are actually acquiring language. Knowing whose advice to trust \u00b6 It may seem natural to take as much people\u2019s advice as you can, after all, they have experience right? Maybe you can learn something valuable? Well, not quite. If the person you are taking advice from has not achieved what you want to achieve, then you have no reason to trust their advice. If you do, then you will get no better than the low level they are at right now. As a beginner, you have no way to properly judge someone\u2019s language ability, as your linguistic competence of the language is very low, or virtually non existent, therefore you are no one to judge if your friend is really good at Japanese or not. Why is this important? Because I often come across people that say things like \u201cBut my friend that learns Japanese told me that\u2026\u201d and the thing that the friend told the other friend is usually pretty misguided and blatantly false. Has your friend achieved something close to what you want to achieve? If not, you do not have much luck getting past the low level they are at if you follow their advice. It would be like taking dieting advice from someone that's fat. \u201dLearning\u201d Japanese Effectively \u00b6 Now that you know the basics of language acquisition, let\u2019s dive into how to learn Japanese. Kana \u00b6 Kana refers to hiragana and katakana , they are the two scripts of the Japanese language. Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same sounds in the language. Hiragana is used for words and names not written in kanji and for grammatical purposes. The writer can choose whether or not to use the kanji form. Katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages and foreign names, it can also be used for emphasis, however, the usages of hiragana and katakana are not always consistent, so take note of that. The kana is not hard to master and therefore I\u2019d say, learn it however you want. It\u2019s better if you have audio with it, too. Mnemonics may seem like a good idea, but I\u2019ve seen people complain that it makes the process of recalling the kana slower, so I\u2019d say just brute force it. You need to learn this first. I recommend you read Tae Kim and pause after The Writing System . This is to dispell any misconceptions you may have about kana, so you know exactly what they are and how they are used at first hand. After that you should copy out the chart below in a notebook or something similar. You may never need to use a pen ever again after this. The Chart: Click to view large image When you've done that you should go on DJT Kana and check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. Make sure you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! Steps if you got confused: Read Tae Kim until you complete The Writing System Copy out the chart above into a notebook or something similar. Test yourself by using DJT Kana . Make sure you check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. MAKE SURE you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! After a week or so, you should have all the kana nailed down. Kanji \u00b6 Kanji taught to Japanese 1st graders. Kanji, literally meaning \"Chinese Characters\" is the third part of the Japanese writing system. They are logographic and therefore much more complex than kana. There are 2136 kanji taught in the Japanese school system, however don\u2019t let this fool you. Around 3000 or more are used in daily life. Kanji are used when they are used. You will eventually understand what this means when you get a little more advanced in Japanese. Above is a page from the Love Live! Sunshine!! manga, showing hiragana, katakana and kanji. Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study There\u2019s two ways to approach kanji. One is kanji with vocab which is to learn words from reading without studying the individual kanji. You can fully comprehend \"\u5b88\u92ad\u5974\" without knowing what the individual kanji mean just by looking it up in a dictionary. The other is isolated kanji study which is studying the meaning and composition of the individual kanji. Example: \"\u5b88\"(guard)\"\u92ad\"(coin)\"\u5974\"(guy) = cheapskate. Huh? It\u2019s pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make remembering vocab easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of time it takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. \u203b Another interesting thing about kanji with vocab, is that if you know other words that also use the kanji of said word, it can become easier to remember. (Example: If you can comprehend \" \u5b88 \u8b77\", \" \u92ad \u6e6f\" and \"\u58f2\u56fd \u5974 \" then \" \u5b88\u92ad\u5974 \" becomes easier) How to: Kanji with Vocab This is the most simplest approach to kanji, and it is the approach I took personally. Most people will be able to read kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you can\u2019t do the same for kanji. So how do you learn to read kanji? Look at the manga picture above. Look at the first panel. You see \"\u4eba\u6570\"? That\u2019s a word. Look it up in a dictionary such as Jisho . You get the reading: \"\u306b\u3093\u305a\u3046 (ninzuu)\" and the meaning: \"number of people\". Cool, move on. That\u2019s it. But don\u2019t expect to remember words just by looking it up once, that is why you should read a lot to build up and retain kanji skill. At the end of the guide I will go through how to make the process of looking up words easier. How to: Isolated Kanji Study When approaching kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles rather than familiar shapes. Kanji have common shapes and patterns and Isolated Kanji Study helps you see those common shapes and patterns. Instead of \"\u8349\" looking like a random drawing, you can see that it\u2019s composed from \"\u8279\", \"\u65e5\" and \"\u5341\". An isolated kanji study method I recommend is Kodansha kanji learner's course (KKLC) , you can get the book here and a study guide here . Don't learn the vocabulary in the book! Only learn vocabulary as described in the Vocabulary and Mining sections. With that said, by reading and looking up words for hours and hours on end, you will learn how to recognize kanji intuitively, however many people may struggle to read Japanese kanji without prior study, and isolated kanji study might help you in this case, as it gives you a hint of what the kanji means beforehand. However isolated kanji study is a significant time investment that does not contribute to knowing Japanese in any meaningful way, and to truly \"learn kanji\" you need to do kanji with vocab anyway. You should decide by yourself whether or not you want to do isolated kanji study. Vocabulary \u00b6 The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary, so you will be doing a lot of it. Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS) flashcard program. It is designed to help you remember information. You can get it here You should use Anki to build up a vocabulary of basic words to assist your immersion, after that learning vocabulary from immersion, especially in reading, becomes easier. Usually people use the Core 2K deck to build up a vocabulary of 2000 words. It works by showing you the word you need to learn at the front, and it has the meaning and how to read it at the back, along with a voiced example sentence. You learn words with Core2K by recalling the meaning and reading of the displayed word. However, I advise against using Core 2K, and suggest you do Tango N5+N4 instead, and here\u2019s why: Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has the sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front. Tango decks work by showing you a sentence at the front, and the piece of information (a meaning and reading) needed to understand the sentence at the back. You click \"Good\" whenever you understood the sentence, and \"Again\" when you did not. The \"N\" number in the deck name refers to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), with N5 being the lowest, easiest and N1 being the highest. Sentences make recalling vocabulary easier, after all, it is much more close to how we use language in real life as opposed to isolated words. However, it is important to note that Tango's translations are not literal, and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I guess that's a flaw of Tango. In other cases, it might be utterly wrong. People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you don\u2019t want to do isolated kanji study! I recommend you start learning vocabulary using Anki after you have learned the kana and know extremely basic grammar. How basic is extremely basic is up to you to decide. I will go through how to study grammar after this section, so don't panic. Grammar \u00b6 When approaching grammar, it is important to know that the purpose of a grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language, but to give you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and then a true understanding of grammar can only be achieved through immersion. Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it and do immersion. Choosing a grammar guide There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad. To prevent confusion amongst learners, i will only mention 2 grammar guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect, they each have their ups and downs. Tae Kim is written pretty well, and very beginner friendly, however some of his explanations may be a little off and it can get boring to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese \u201corganic\u201d way. However, Cure Dolly is not the most absolute beginner friendly, you need at least some background knowledge before using. Also, the audio is very poor. You can find the 2 grammar guides below: Tae Kim There is also an Android and iOS app for offline viewing!, note that everything in this guide is considered to be \"basic Japanese\", even the \u201cadvanced\u201d section Cure Dolly I recommend turning on subtitles and setting the speed to 1.25x! With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your immersion and vocabulary study. Mining \u00b6 Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence they were found in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these flashcards overtime to make sure you don\u2019t forget them. It usually recommended you begin mining right after you finished Tango N5+N4. You should not bother with Tango N3, N2 and/or N1 because at this point you should be making your own flashcards from your immersion, which is overall a fun process. Mining is something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty important. There\u2019s a lot of disagreement when it comes to \u201cformats\u201d of mining, but I think the \"Anime cards\" format is very good, and has served me really well. Animecards Vocab Cards Animecards are High Quality vocab cards which are different to standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards simply have the word in kanji form on the front, and the reading and meaning of that word at the back. High quality vocab cards, as opposed to standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or voiced Visual Novel), also a picture (from an anime or Visual Novel) and the sentence it came from at the back, making them much more superior to standard vocab cards. I think it is good to graduate sentence cards after you finish Tango N5 and N4 (Tango decks are sentence cards by the way), as vocabulary cards become easy and quick as you have familiarzied yourself with simple Japanese. \u203b They are known as \u201cAnime Cards\u201d because of AnimeCards Site Benefits + Easy to set up + Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these. + Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1) + Compensates for words with multiple meanings with the hint field. After you have finished the Tango N5 and N4 decks, you should read this site AnimeCards Site to learn how to set up a mining deck. How to Immerse (inputting) \u00b6 What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage you are on. This is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide is difficult. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner. Listening \u00b6 First of all, when it comes to immersing, you must learn to tolerate the ambiguity. The point is not to understand everything. It is not uncommon for learners to feel down over not understanding anything but I think it is totally fine not understanding, you should make merry every word you recognize, every little bit you do understand and just because you don't understand now, that doesn't mean you will not always not understand. The most important part of learning Japanese is enjoying yourself . When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over reading immersion. This is because when you first approach a foreign language, you are not yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language, so reading may give you a poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from your native language to Japanese, it is impossible to read without mapping some phonetic component, so you can only avoid this by first getting used to the phonemes and you can only do this by doing raw listening. Furthermore, listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as you need to constantly look up words probably every second. Surprisingly, there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, especially when you are studying grammar and vocabulary alongside your immersion, so it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don\u2019t understand other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input remember? That is true, however, you are still benefiting from incomprehensible input but in a different way; it is improving your ability to distinguish phonemes, in other words giving you a better accent. Immersing even if you don\u2019t understand much is also a great way to build up a habit of interacting with your Japanese. With that said though, immersion (input) at this stage will still be largely incomprehensible, however you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks. Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active Immersion). Just putting it on in the background and not paying attention (Passive Immersion) is not going to help you. Choosing what to immerse with It\u2019s usually best to immerse with something with a visual and audio component, such as anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual component, and also a plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. It is not recommended to immerse with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as it will be difficult to perceive what is going on. If you are learning Japanese, then chances are you are a fan of anime so you can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains. What do I need to be \u201cdoing\u201d while actively immersing? (As a beginner) Try to understand messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV show. Like Krashen says, you need to have \u201cmeaningful\u201d (meaning focused) interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as grammar). Reading \u00b6 Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly. However, as a newbie to the language, there are a few problems that arise when it comes to reading early on in the process. Reading early can have a bad effect on your accent. And your reading ability may not always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably low. When you\u2019re a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best, similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background isn\u2019t going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need to do raw listening. You can see animecards.site to learn how to watch anime with Japanese subtitles. Anyway, I think it is good to start out with Japanese subtitles for reading. And transition to manga, and then light novels/visual novels and so on. I think it is important you pace yourself when reading and don\u2019t burn out trying to read hard novels as a beginner, it is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level. In our Resources you can find links to sites that let you read a lot of Japanese manga and novels, for free. And Japanese subtitles too, so make sure you check that out! Finding the balance between listening and reading Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in half, and if you are able to do that, then that is great. However, not everyone has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current level, it may be considerably difficult to read for extended hours. For example people that have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on your schedule and current level. You don\u2019t need to do reading from day 1, give it a few weeks until you can read basic words from the Tango N5 Anki deck. Summary \u00b6 Learn the kana and start learning from your chosen grammar guide. Download and setup Anki. Import the Tango N5 deck by clicking on it. Click the cog icon next to the deck > Options. The default limit of new cards per day is set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, then you can lower the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the \u201cReviews\u201d tab, set the Maximum reviews/day to 9999. Don\u2019t be startled by this number. It will likely not go over 150 with okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the reviews you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of lowering the maximum reviews. This is because not doing your due reviews interferes with Anki\u2019s spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. Personally I do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Do Anki daily, while also doing your chosen grammar guide and immersing daily. Repeat until you have finished Tango N5, now you should do Tango N4. You should feel more comfortable with reading now, I suggest you start reading easy manga or watch anime with Japanese subtitles. After you've finished Tango N4, set up your mining deck, watch whatever you like, read whatever you like and HAVE FUN!! Final Notes \u00b6 That\u2019s it. You can get fluent in Japanese just like that. But don\u2019t forget that the most important part is immersion, Anki and grammar only assist your immersion. Music is not immersion. However, you can use the lyric sheet as reading practice. This guide would have not been possible if it was not for Stephen Krashen, Mass Immersion Approach, All Japanese All The Time, AntiMoon, Daily Japanese Thread/Itazuraneko, and my brothers and sisters here in TheMoeWay.

You can read how to set it up here For manga, I recommend KanjiTomo , it\u2019s like Yomichan but for situations where you can\u2019t select the text, e.g. in manga. It uses an OCR, so a little less reliable than Yomichan. To use, hover your mouse over whatever you want to look up. Android tools \u00b6 If you have an Android device, you can use Yomichan on Kiwi Browser. You can get the app Rin which adds the iOS \u201cLook Up\u201d feature to your select menu. There is also OCR Manga Reader which works a little like KanjiTomo. You should get Typhon Reader , which works more like Yomichan. You can load .epub files into it, so it is the best way to read Japanese novels on your phone. There\u2019s also Kaku , it\u2019s a system wide OCR. Pretty useful too. iOS tools \u00b6 If you use an iOS device, you can use Books to read novels on your phone. You can use the \u201cLook Up\u201d feature. Make sure you have Japanese dictionaries enabled in Settings > General > Dictionary. Kantan Manga Reader is the iOS equivalent of OCR Manga Reader.

What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don\u2019t ever reach this goal, or even get close. I believe it mostly isn\u2019t their fault, but rather, the method \u2019s fault. Whether you\u2019re a \u201cvisual learner\u201d or an \u201cauditory learner\u201d does not mean anything when it comes to learning a language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language by hearing it (like we all did) but apparently you\u2019re more of a \u201cvisual learner.\u201d It mostly comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I believe the method in the first place is very important. For example, if someone told you that you could learn to swim by reading a book about swimming, would you be able to swim after you finished that book? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method - it does not work. What this guide aims to do is educate you on effective methods to study Japanese, so that you don\u2019t end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all while having fun in your target language, and in this case, your target language is most likely Japanese. Back to the \u201cvisual learner\u201d and \u201cauditory learner\u201d thing, while it may be true for other fields of study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all acquire language in the same exact way, and that is through comprehensible input . I often come across people saying, \u201ceveryone learns differently\u201d and again, this may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition . Key word: acquisition.","title":"Why many people \u201cfail\u201d to learn Japanese"},{"location":"guide/#learning-vs-acquisition","text":"Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to what one experiences in school. The individual is given \u201cgrammar rules\u201d and/or a \u201cvocabulary list\u201d to remember. When it comes to communicating in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and try to use that to speak the language. According to Stephen Krashen, the leading linguist in language acquisition, this is less effective than acquisition. Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious process of which individuals need not be aware. What this actually means is, this process is fundamentally the same for everyone, hence natural and acquired pieces of language can be utilized intuitively , where the individual, in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition process may not feel like \u201clanguage learning\u201d and when new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. Acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than form. What this means is, one is not concerned with the form of the language they are hearing and/or their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. \u203b \u201cLearning Japanese\u201d may improperly refer to both acquiring and learning.

Comprehensible input refers to input where messages are conveyed and understood. It is the most crucial ingredient in the acquisition of language. Any input is not sufficient for acquisition, the input must be comprehensible . However, as a beginner, it may seem difficult to find comprehensible input, and that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from incomprehensible input , too, but not in the same way. Language is not acquired from incomprehensible input but from comprehensible input. So please keep that in mind. It is also important to keep in mind that talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people give anecdotes of how they got better at a language by speaking a lot, they do not realise that it was the input (from the partner) which improved their skill at the language.

Because I often come across people that say things like \u201cBut my friend that learns Japanese told me that\u2026\u201d and the thing that the friend told the other friend is usually pretty misguided and blatantly false.

Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study There\u2019s two ways to approach kanji. One is kanji with vocab which is to learn words from reading without studying the individual kanji. You can fully comprehend \"\u5b88\u92ad\u5974\" without knowing what the individual kanji mean just by looking it up in a dictionary. The other is isolated kanji study which is studying the meaning and composition of the individual kanji. Example: \"\u5b88\"(guard)\"\u92ad\"(coin)\"\u5974\"(guy) = cheapskate. Huh? It\u2019s pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make remembering vocab easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of time it takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. \u203b Another interesting thing about kanji with vocab, is that if you know other words that also use the kanji of said word, it can become easier to remember. (Example: If you can comprehend \" \u5b88 \u8b77\", \" \u92ad \u6e6f\" and \"\u58f2\u56fd \u5974 \" then \" \u5b88\u92ad\u5974 \" becomes easier) How to: Kanji with Vocab This is the most simplest approach to kanji, and it is the approach I took personally. Most people will be able to read kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you can\u2019t do the same for kanji. So how do you learn to read kanji? Look at the manga picture above. Look at the first panel. You see \"\u4eba\u6570\"? That\u2019s a word. Look it up in a dictionary such as Jisho . You get the reading: \"\u306b\u3093\u305a\u3046 (ninzuu)\" and the meaning: \"number of people\". Cool, move on. That\u2019s it. But don\u2019t expect to remember words just by looking it up once, that is why you should read a lot to build up and retain kanji skill. At the end of the guide I will go through how to make the process of looking up words easier. How to: Isolated Kanji Study When approaching kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles rather than familiar shapes. Kanji have common shapes and patterns and Isolated Kanji Study helps you see those common shapes and patterns. Instead of \"\u8349\" looking like a random drawing, you can see that it\u2019s composed from \"\u8279\", \"\u65e5\" and \"\u5341\". An isolated kanji study method I recommend is Kodansha kanji learner's course (KKLC) , you can get the book here and a study guide here . Don't learn the vocabulary in the book! Only learn vocabulary as described in the Vocabulary and Mining sections. With that said, by reading and looking up words for hours and hours on end, you will learn how to recognize kanji intuitively, however many people may struggle to read Japanese kanji without prior study, and isolated kanji study might help you in this case, as it gives you a hint of what the kanji means beforehand. However isolated kanji study is a significant time investment that does not contribute to knowing Japanese in any meaningful way, and to truly \"learn kanji\" you need to do kanji with vocab anyway. You should decide by yourself whether or not you want to do isolated kanji study.","title":"Kanji"},{"location":"guide/#vocabulary","text":"The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary, so you will be doing a lot of it. Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS) flashcard program. It is designed to help you remember information. You can get it here You should use Anki to build up a vocabulary of basic words to assist your immersion, after that learning vocabulary from immersion, especially in reading, becomes easier. Usually people use the Core 2K deck to build up a vocabulary of 2000 words. It works by showing you the word you need to learn at the front, and it has the meaning and how to read it at the back, along with a voiced example sentence. You learn words with Core2K by recalling the meaning and reading of the displayed word. However, I advise against using Core 2K, and suggest you do Tango N5+N4 instead, and here\u2019s why: Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has the sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front. Tango decks work by showing you a sentence at the front, and the piece of information (a meaning and reading) needed to understand the sentence at the back. You click \"Good\" whenever you understood the sentence, and \"Again\" when you did not. The \"N\" number in the deck name refers to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), with N5 being the lowest, easiest and N1 being the highest. Sentences make recalling vocabulary easier, after all, it is much more close to how we use language in real life as opposed to isolated words. However, it is important to note that Tango's translations are not literal, and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I guess that's a flaw of Tango. In other cases, it might be utterly wrong. People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you don\u2019t want to do isolated kanji study! I recommend you start learning vocabulary using Anki after you have learned the kana and know extremely basic grammar. How basic is extremely basic is up to you to decide. I will go through how to study grammar after this section, so don't panic.","title":"Vocabulary"},{"location":"guide/#grammar","text":"When approaching grammar, it is important to know that the purpose of a grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language, but to give you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and then a true understanding of grammar can only be achieved through immersion. Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it and do immersion. Choosing a grammar guide There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad. To prevent confusion amongst learners, i will only mention 2 grammar guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect, they each have their ups and downs. Tae Kim is written pretty well, and very beginner friendly, however some of his explanations may be a little off and it can get boring to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese \u201corganic\u201d way. However, Cure Dolly is not the most absolute beginner friendly, you need at least some background knowledge before using. Also, the audio is very poor. You can find the 2 grammar guides below: Tae Kim There is also an Android and iOS app for offline viewing!, note that everything in this guide is considered to be \"basic Japanese\", even the \u201cadvanced\u201d section Cure Dolly I recommend turning on subtitles and setting the speed to 1.25x! With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your immersion and vocabulary study.","title":"Grammar"},{"location":"guide/#mining","text":"Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence they were found in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these flashcards overtime to make sure you don\u2019t forget them. It usually recommended you begin mining right after you finished Tango N5+N4. You should not bother with Tango N3, N2 and/or N1 because at this point you should be making your own flashcards from your immersion, which is overall a fun process. Mining is something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty important. There\u2019s a lot of disagreement when it comes to \u201cformats\u201d of mining, but I think the \"Anime cards\" format is very good, and has served me really well. Animecards Vocab Cards Animecards are High Quality vocab cards which are different to standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards simply have the word in kanji form on the front, and the reading and meaning of that word at the back. High quality vocab cards, as opposed to standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or voiced Visual Novel), also a picture (from an anime or Visual Novel) and the sentence it came from at the back, making them much more superior to standard vocab cards. I think it is good to graduate sentence cards after you finish Tango N5 and N4 (Tango decks are sentence cards by the way), as vocabulary cards become easy and quick as you have familiarzied yourself with simple Japanese. \u203b They are known as \u201cAnime Cards\u201d because of AnimeCards Site Benefits + Easy to set up + Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these. + Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1) + Compensates for words with multiple meanings with the hint field. After you have finished the Tango N5 and N4 decks, you should read this site AnimeCards Site to learn how to set up a mining deck.","title":"Mining"},{"location":"guide/#how-to-immerse-inputting","text":"What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage you are on. This is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide is difficult. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner.","title":"How to Immerse (inputting)"},{"location":"guide/#listening","text":"First of all, when it comes to immersing, you must learn to tolerate the ambiguity. The point is not to understand everything. It is not uncommon for learners to feel down over not understanding anything but I think it is totally fine not understanding, you should make merry every word you recognize, every little bit you do understand and just because you don't understand now, that doesn't mean you will not always not understand. The most important part of learning Japanese is enjoying yourself . When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over reading immersion. This is because when you first approach a foreign language, you are not yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language, so reading may give you a poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from your native language to Japanese, it is impossible to read without mapping some phonetic component, so you can only avoid this by first getting used to the phonemes and you can only do this by doing raw listening. Furthermore, listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as you need to constantly look up words probably every second. Surprisingly, there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, especially when you are studying grammar and vocabulary alongside your immersion, so it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don\u2019t understand other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input remember? That is true, however, you are still benefiting from incomprehensible input but in a different way; it is improving your ability to distinguish phonemes, in other words giving you a better accent. Immersing even if you don\u2019t understand much is also a great way to build up a habit of interacting with your Japanese. With that said though, immersion (input) at this stage will still be largely incomprehensible, however you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks. Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active Immersion). Just putting it on in the background and not paying attention (Passive Immersion) is not going to help you. Choosing what to immerse with It\u2019s usually best to immerse with something with a visual and audio component, such as anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual component, and also a plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. It is not recommended to immerse with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as it will be difficult to perceive what is going on. If you are learning Japanese, then chances are you are a fan of anime so you can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains. What do I need to be \u201cdoing\u201d while actively immersing? (As a beginner) Try to understand messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV show. Like Krashen says, you need to have \u201cmeaningful\u201d (meaning focused) interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as grammar).","title":"Listening"},{"location":"guide/#reading","text":"Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly. However, as a newbie to the language, there are a few problems that arise when it comes to reading early on in the process. Reading early can have a bad effect on your accent. And your reading ability may not always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably low. When you\u2019re a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best, similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background isn\u2019t going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need to do raw listening. You can see animecards.site to learn how to watch anime with Japanese subtitles. Anyway, I think it is good to start out with Japanese subtitles for reading. And transition to manga, and then light novels/visual novels and so on. I think it is important you pace yourself when reading and don\u2019t burn out trying to read hard novels as a beginner, it is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level. In our Resources you can find links to sites that let you read a lot of Japanese manga and novels, for free. And Japanese subtitles too, so make sure you check that out! Finding the balance between listening and reading Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in half, and if you are able to do that, then that is great. However, not everyone has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current level, it may be considerably difficult to read for extended hours. For example people that have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on your schedule and current level. You don\u2019t need to do reading from day 1, give it a few weeks until you can read basic words from the Tango N5 Anki deck.","title":"Reading"},{"location":"guide/#summary","text":"Learn the kana and start learning from your chosen grammar guide. Download and setup Anki. Import the Tango N5 deck by clicking on it. Click the cog icon next to the deck > Options. The default limit of new cards per day is set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, then you can lower the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the \u201cReviews\u201d tab, set the Maximum reviews/day to 9999. Don\u2019t be startled by this number. It will likely not go over 150 with okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the reviews you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of lowering the maximum reviews. This is because not doing your due reviews interferes with Anki\u2019s spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. Personally I do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Do Anki daily, while also doing your chosen grammar guide and immersing daily. Repeat until you have finished Tango N5, now you should do Tango N4. You should feel more comfortable with reading now, I suggest you start reading easy manga or watch anime with Japanese subtitles. After you've finished Tango N4, set up your mining deck, watch whatever you like, read whatever you like and HAVE FUN!!","title":"Summary"},{"location":"guide/#final-notes","text":"That\u2019s it.

You can't just \"learn\" a kanji because kanji has so much components to them that one cannot simply say they have apparently \"learned\" it. It's like saying, \"I learned a car\", \"I learned gaming\", heck even \"I learned Japanese\" for example. What on earth do you even mean when you say \"I'm learning kanji\"? This page will go through how useful isolated kanji study is, which is what most people do and think of when they say \"learn kanji\". We all should know that your long time kanji study will be Kanji with Vocab. With that said, let's see how useful isolated kanji study is! Learning the Meanings - Kind of Helpful \u00b6 Learning the meanings of a \"kanji\" is great if it's a word itself, such as \u9e93 \u3001 \u6e90 \u3001 \u529b etc. However, one can argue that you are literally learning a word not a kanji . Furthermore, learning the meanings for kanji can be useful for words like \u9023\u7d9a , \"take along, continue\" the kanji mean serial, consecutive . Remembering this can be helpful if you have constant trouble recalling the meaning of a certain word. However, the effectiveness of remembering meanings can be disputed. It is argued that these keywords assigned to kanji fade away as you get better at Japanese, and if you are good at Japanese and never studied kanji meanings, you would know what \u9023 means anyway. If you learn \u8336 as a word, you'll know it's tea . So if you come across \u7d05\u8336 and \u62b9\u8336 you may be able to guess that they are also some kind of tea . In addition to that, Japanese people would describe \u9023 as \" \u9023\u52dd \u306e\u9023\" or \" \u9023\u5c04 \u306e\u9023\" etc; not the keyword you learned. Summary: Kind of useful when you're a beginner, but not needed at all. Learning the Readings (by themselves) - A big NO. \u00b6 I'm not talking about learning words, like having \u5922\u4e2d along with a handy example sentence I mean this: Kanji: \u6daf Kun: \u306f\u3066 On: \u30ac\u30a4 \u2191 DON'T LEARN KANJI LIKE THIS \u2191 Learning kanji readings individually is a complete utter waste of time. Kanji readings are not consistent. Many kanji have multiple onyomi and kunyomi, for instance, \u5bb6\u8def [\u3044\u3048\u3058], \u901a\u8def [\u3064\u3046\u308d], \u5bb6\u8cc3 [\u3084\u3061\u3093], \u6f2b\u753b\u5bb6 ([\u307e\u3093\u304c\u304b], \u5c0f\u5b66\u6821 [\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304c\u3063\u3053\u3046], \u888b\u5c0f\u8def [\u3075\u304f\u308d\u3053\u3046\u3058], \u7d20\u8db3 [\u3059\u3042\u3057], \u7d20\u4eba [\u3057\u308d\u3046\u3068], \u604b\u4eba [\u3053\u3044\u3073\u3068], \u65e5\u672c\u4eba [\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3058\u3093], \u72e9\u4eba [\u304b\u308a\u3085\u3046\u3069] and our favourite: \u751f , \u5148\u751f [\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044], \u751f\u6daf [\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304c\u3044], \u751f\u7c8b [\u304d\u3063\u3059\u3044], \u829d\u751f [\u3057\u3070\u3075], \u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u308b [\u3044\u304d\u306e\u3053\u308b], \u751f\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb [\u306a\u307e\u3073\u30fc\u308b], \u751f\u771f\u9762\u76ee [\u304d\u307e\u3058\u3081], \u751f\u3044\u8302\u308b [\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3052\u308b] Furthermore, it is also difficult remembering kanji in this way: \u6daf Kun: \u306f\u3066 On: \u30ac\u30a4 It's much easier remembering it in a word, like \u751f\u6daf on an Anki card or something. If you learned \u6d99\u817a \u300c\u308b\u3044\u305b\u3093\u300d and come across \u71b1\u6d99 , you will obviously be able to read the \u6d99 portion as \u308b\u3044, am I not wrong? In addition, the readings will be easier to remember in context of real words that you can actually use. Essentially, memorizing the readings by themselves is a complete waste of time. Summary: Useless. Don't learn readings, learn words. Learning the Stroke Order - Essential \u00b6 Learning the stroke order is essential, now I don't mean it in the sense of actively try to remember every stroke order for every new character, no, I mean getting down the basics, that way you can get the stroke order for new characters right with 90% accuracy, for example the rules for writing boxes like \u53e3 and what goes inside them, or rules for how to order the vertical and horizontal strokes when they cross each other like \u4e95 or \u8279 or \u738b or \u4e30 or \u7f8a etc. How \u5df1 is written which can be applied to \u8d77, the bottom portion of that can be learned by learning the strokes for \u8db3. Learning the first stroke of \u30c1 (katakana) can be applied to \u79c1 which can be applied to \u9999 and \u99a8. This isn't the same thing as RTK, that's different, but similar. It all connects. Of course, for awkward characters like \u98db you might need to look up the stroke order. But after you get the basics down for say, \u62bc, and \u8eca, writing something you don't know like \u63ee won't be a problem Summary: Essential, but don't overdo yourself. Learning how to write them - Depends \u00b6 This isn't the same thing as what I just talked about last time. Unfortunately, even if you literally know the word and the stroke order of the kanji that compose the word, it is very likely that when it actually comes to writing the word, you won't be able to recall how to write it. This problem can be overcome by individually learning how to write each word. You can do this by writing out sentences (don't write isolated words, write sentences, this helps with proportions). However, the utility value of this can be disputed. With today's technology, do you really need to learn how to write all those words? Probably not. You can just input it into your IME. With this said, consider your priorities, if you work in Japan and need to write Japanese as a part of your job this will obviously be essential for you. If not, then personally I don't see the point. Summary: Depends. Conclusion - learn words \u00b6 I hate the phrase, \"I am learning kanji\", it makes no sense. Every time someone says that they obviously don't know what they've supposedly learned is, to put it simply, useless. Whatever fancy cool way to remember all those wow so much >2,000 kanji (RTK, KKLC, WaniKani etc.) you use, you still need to read Japanese for hundreds of hours and remember a lot of vocabulary to truly \"learn a kanji\". I don't consider a kanji \"learned\" unless you know all the common words that use the kanji and are able to write it completely from memory. Don't \"learn kanji\", learn words. Don't \"learn\" kanji, feel kanji.

If not, then personally I don't see the point.

This guide will go through what the monolingual transition is and why you should do it, different mediums to access monolingual dictionaries and also ways to approach getting used to monolingual dictionaries. This guide is long. But it is still simple, it\u2019s just the initial setup that just feels long. What is the monolingual transition \u00b6 The monolingual transition is when you \u201ctransition\" into getting used to a monolingual dictionary, often with the help of a bilingual dictionary as an aid. A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d. Jisho.org is not its own dictionary, it is only a portal that accesses JMdict. So keep that in mind. Why you should use a monolingual dictionary \u00b6 Monolingual dictionaries help you avoid making false associations with words from your native language (probably English) to Japanese. You may think, oh, what if I\u2019m not even English? If you don\u2019t use a monolingual dictionary, then you will make false associations anyway, no matter what your native language is. What if I\u2019m German and I use the Wadoku (Japanese-German bilingual dictionary)? Same thing. You will still have this problem. There is no language that can express Japanese better than Japanese itself. What exactly do you mean by \u201cfalse associations\u201d? \u00b6 Bilingual definitions, 90% of the time are very vague, and do not capture the true feeling of the word. You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: \u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044] If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word. And chances are you learned it using a bilingual dictionary. Let\u2019s look at the bilingual definition. vexing; annoying You may think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition. Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797) \u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002 My translation of the definition: Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it). And this gets less accurate when you put it into English. Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not. Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example. \u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044] Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d. You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem. The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually. Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you. Why people find it hard to go monolingual. \u00b6 Two reasons: They don\u2019t know the words. Are not used to the written Japanese. Monolingual transition myths \u00b6 A profound belief that \"dictionary vocabulary\" exist. The truth: \u201cDictionary vocabulary\u201d = words you don\u2019t know because you don\u2019t read enough. Using Morphman to assist the monolingual transition \u00b6 No. Morphman is an Anki addon (?) which automatically decides what words to add to Anki for you. And for that reason it is a failure. Don\u2019t leave it up to a silly computer program to help you decide what to add to Anki. Also most of what Morphman decides what to add for you is like \u201c\u30d5\u30a5...\u201d, \u201c(\u266a\uff5e)\u201d, \u201c\u3042\u3063...\u201d so unless you\u2019re into that I advise you to avoid using Morphman. If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it. The idea here is, when you are looking up stuff, it is inevitable you are going to remember some things but forget others, so when you go back and read/watch it again, you mine all the words you failed to remember the first time. You may think, \u201cI probably don\u2019t need those words though\u201d. Wrong. Yes you do. You need every word that comes up in your immersion. Yomichan - the better way to go monolingual. \u00b6 I recommend doing the monolingual transition with Yomichan. Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words on a webpage by holding Shift and hovering over it. It is supported by any Chromium or Firefox based browser. You can find out how to set up Yomichan here Optimizing Yomichan Settings \u00b6 First you need to ensure that Advanced options is enabled. Second, we want to remove any and all scan delays because we will be making heavy use of this extension and wouldn't want to be slowed down by anything. Now we will enable scanning within pop-ups, this is very important, as we want to be able to look up any words we don't know within a definiton. You may want to increase the size of your Yomichan pop up window because by default it is pretty small and will become a hindrance when using monolingual dictionaries. To make enough headroom to use Yomichan dictionaries comfortably we are going to edit the following settings. Here's how our pop up looks now: Next, if you want, you don't need to but I recommend it, enable automatic audio playback, so we know how to pronounce a word correctly the moment we look it up. Also add the extra audio source because surprisingly it adds extra audio! You can also add the Forvo audio source in Yomichan. See Yomichan Setup Tutorial for more info. Update December 2021: You should also add a text replacement rule for words with kanji repetition marks, they usually do not appear in monolingual dictionaries unless you repeat the kanji itself. Example:\u3000\u56c2\u3005 won't appear in most monolingual dictionaries but \u56c2\u56c2 will. Go to Settings -> Translation -> Custom Text Replacement Patterns and add the following rule: Pattern: (.)\u3005 Replacement: $1$1 I will touch on dictionaries in the next section. Getting and using monolingual dictionaries \u00b6 Again, I recommend you use monolingual dictionaries with Yomichan. I will talk about alternatives later. You can find my dictionaries collection here: shoui Yomichan Dictionaries Collection Before we continue, have a read on recommended dictionaries and what they are exactly.

It is quite an authoritative dictionary in Japan, however it is not the most popular. This dictionary sorts its definitions from oldest to newest, which is not useful to learners of modern Japanese. Nevertheless, this dictionary has its own charm that I like. \u5927\u8f9e\u6797 \u7b2c\u4e09\u7248 - an extension of the 3rd edition of the Daijirin, 2015. It has a wide assortment of words, expressions, proper nouns, grammar and connectives (actually more important than you think!). It is a a great all-rounder and personally my most used dictionary. \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 - Digital Daijisen, May 2021. The QUEEN of online dictionaries. This is the dictionary hosted on the Goo Dictionary , it has a lot of new words, expressions, images and kanji entries. The previous issue where the headword was missing has been fixed. Currently images won't work for Anki cards. (See Yomichan Issue #1741 ) \u65fa\u6587\u793e\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u5341\u4e00\u7248 - Oubunsha Kokugo Dictionary 11th Editon. Short name: Oukoku (\u65fa\u56fd) is a monolingual dictionary published by Oubunsha in 2013. This dictionary's main selling point is how precise and easy to understand it is. And rightfully so; comparitively this dictionary has the most easiest to understand definitions. It explains the difference between kanji usages, \u9022\u3046, \u4f1a\u3046 etc. and is also really nice for grammar definitions. It is my #1 recommendation for people new to monolingual dictionaries. This version has images. But currently images won't work for Anki cards. (See Yomichan Issue #1741 \u65fa\u6587\u793e\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u5341\u4e00\u7248 \u753b\u50cf\u7121\u3057 - No-image version of the above. \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797 - Hybrid Shinjirin, 1998. This is based on the second edition of the Daijirin, but simplified. (actually was based on the \u8f9e\u679721, which was also based on the Daijirin 2nd edition). It explains the difference between different kanji usages which is nice. My #3 recommendation for beginners. \u7cbe\u9078\u7248 \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 - Seisenban Nihonkokugodaijiten, 2016(?). Short name: Nikkoku (\u65e5\u56fd) is the biggest Japanese monolingual dictionary ever published, the physical version has multiple fascicles. This dictionary is the great for how much \u6f22\u8a9e it has, expressions, proper nouns, and specializes in classical Japanese. The example sentences look quite archaic because they are, they show the first known use of the word. This is the dictionary found on Kotobank . Not recommended at all for beginners but you'll love this when you're advanced. \u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - Meikyou Kokugo Dictionary is a Japanese monolingual dictionary published in 2002 and this is the first edition. What I like about the Meikyou is how it is easier to understand than dictionaries like the Daijirin and Daijsen, and also talks about the difference between kanji usage etc. \u6483\u3064 \u6253\u3064. It is also really nice for basic grammar definitions. This is my #2 recommendation for people new to monolingual dictionaries. \u5ca9\u6ce2\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - Iwanami Kokugo Dictionary, 6th edition, 2000. I have not used this dictionary enough to know it's strong points but it has a similar feeling to the Meikyou. \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e94\u7248 - Shinmeikai Kokugo Dictionary, 5th edition, 1999. This dictionary is widely known for it's unique style of defining words. It also uses simple-er language for definitions, but the explanations can get \u307e\u308f\u308a\u304f\u3069\u3044, and thus hard to understand for learners. #4 recommendation for beginners. \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e03\u7248 - Shinmeikai Kokugo Dictionary, 7th edition, 2017. Newer version of the above but can have troublesome formatting so I left the old version in the pack. This is the most popular dictionary in Japan. \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178 - Jitsuyou Nihongo Hyougen Jiten. This dictionary absolutely rocks! You need this! It will save your life! \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56db\u5b57\u719f\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - A yojijukugo dictionary from the Shinmeikai line of dictionaries. \u5b66\u7814 \u56db\u5b57\u719f\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - A yojijukugo dictionary published by Gakken. \u6545\u4e8b\u3053\u3068\u308f\u3056\u306e\u8f9e\u5178 - A proverbs/idioms dictionary. Weblio\u53e4\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - A classical Japanese dictionary. Continuation: Getting and using monolingual dictionaries \u00b6 Let's continue. Import the set of dictionaries that best suits you in Recommended Dictionaries . \u203b You can change dictionary priority so you can match the order by editing the number next to the dictionary. Higher the number = higher up in list. Why do you say use a lot of dictionaries? \u00b6 You need to have a lot of dictionaries and have every one of them enabled because there will always be some words that are in some dictionaries and not in others. Take for example \u79bf\u540c, that is only in \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178, and \u5922\u6d77\u9f20, which is only in \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178. We want to use monolingual dictionaries as much as possible here. Another reason is that different dictionaries will describe a word in a different way, and in many cases you may not understand one dictionary's definition, but understand another.

Approaching Monolingual Dictionaries \u00b6 There\u2019s a few ways to approach getting used to monolingual dictionaries. I\u2019ll go through each one of them. Primarily in the AJATT community, there\u2019s this one piece of advice: The \u201cThrow away the bilingual dictionary forever, and start using the monolingual dictionary straight away!\u201d Approach \u00b6 This is something Khatzumoto of AJATT proposed. I mean, if you read novels, this may be a pretty good approach, because you will already be familiar with the words, because novels generally just have more words than anime and manga. If you only watch anime and read manga, this may prove to be quite frustrating. When this piece of advice was put out, Yomichan didn\u2019t exist. So people in that time would have found this piece of advice terrible and tiring to constantly look up everything in the definitions. This isn\u2019t a fundamentally flawed approach, I think it\u2019s pretty good how it says \u201cjust read the dictionary more!\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. I just disagree with throwing away the bilingual dictionary completely, because you still need it in the beginning of the monolingual transition. The Morphman Approach \u00b6 no What you SHOULD do \u00b6 How did I learn how to be comfortable with monolingual dictionaries? I read more. (novels, light novels, visual novels) When I read more novels I got more used to written Japanese, and when I looked up words, they were in monolingual, so when I learned more words, I got better at using the monolingual dictionary. Huh? Yeah. It\u2019s really that simple. Read more. Read the novel more = reading the dictionary more because you need a dictionary to read novels :) >What did you do when you came across a word you didn\u2019t know in the definition? \u00b6 I looked it up with Yomichan. I tried reading the monolingual definition. If there were too many words I didn\u2019t know in the definition, I just looked at the English definition (as a last resort) and moved on. You just need to keep doing this. REPETITION. Read more books. You will get comfortable with the monolingual dictionary if you just read a lot. Yes. Read more. Read a lot. That\u2019s all there is to it. Yomichan just makes the process easier, you don\u2019t waste your energy manually searching, instead your energy goes into actually reading. That\u2019s why I recommend using Yomichan. >Soo\u2026 what\u2019s the best way to approach monolingual? \u00b6 Read more novels with a monolingual dictionary. I recommend reading novels on Itazuraneko using Yomichan. >What if I don't like reading novels? I hate reading novels! \u00b6 Find something you like. It can be a light novel or visual novel too you know. I \"hate\" novels in English, I have never tried to read more than 1 page of them, why do I \"hate\" them? Because I haven't experienced how good they actually might be, and I don't care really. But in Japanese, not only am I better at reading novels in Japanese, I also really enjoy reading novels in this language, I can't say the same for English. So even though you may despise novels in whatever your native language is, if you give it a shot (it will be difficult at first, as is everything), you may find yourself actually enjoying reading novels. >shoui have you completely \u5352\u696d'd the bilingual dictionary? \u00b6 Yes indeed. I haven't used the JMdict or anything since last year. >But wouldn\u2019t I be reading the dictionary more than the actual novel? \u00b6 So what? It\u2019s good that you are reading the dictionary more. Think of the dictionary as something FUN. It's fascinating in its own right. 10 Important Tips and Tricks \u00b6 (\u58f1). Read at least 1 novel (it can be a light novel or visual novel) before going monolingual. (\u5f10). Try to experiment with what dictionary order is the best for you. (\u53c2). If the word you look up with Yomichan is only in a bilingual dictionary, try doing a kana search for it, or a full kanji search (Alt+Insert to get to the Yomichan search page) (\u8086). If you don\u2019t understand the definition even if you looked up all the words, just look at/use the bilingual definition (last resort). You will get better at understanding when you use it more. (\u4f0d). It is okay to check the bilingual definition to check that you\u2019re getting the right basic idea. (\u9678). Don\u2019t worry about how much time it will take to \u201ctransition\u201d (\u6f06). For monolingual Anki cards, just try to remember the gist of the definition. I tried to demonstrate this in Japanese FAQ (\u634c). Try to look up words you already know, in the monolingual dictionary, this is just to try to get accustomed to the dictionary at first hand. (\u7396). Forget looking up very concrete nouns such as animals in the monolingual dictionary, you are better off just using Google Images instead. (\u62fe). Don\u2019t overdo yourself! If it's too hard, try to use the bilingual dictionary until you feel confident again! Have fun immersing! Found this useful? Consider supporting me on Patreon!

A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d.

So keep that in mind.","title":"What is the monolingual transition"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-you-should-use-a-monolingual-dictionary","text":"Monolingual dictionaries help you avoid making false associations with words from your native language (probably English) to Japanese. You may think, oh, what if I\u2019m not even English? If you don\u2019t use a monolingual dictionary, then you will make false associations anyway, no matter what your native language is. What if I\u2019m German and I use the Wadoku (Japanese-German bilingual dictionary)? Same thing. You will still have this problem. There is no language that can express Japanese better than Japanese itself.","title":"Why you should use a monolingual dictionary"},{"location":"monolingual/#what-exactly-do-you-mean-by-false-associations","text":"Bilingual definitions, 90% of the time are very vague, and do not capture the true feeling of the word. You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: \u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044] If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word. And chances are you learned it using a bilingual dictionary. Let\u2019s look at the bilingual definition. vexing; annoying You may think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition. Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797) \u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002 My translation of the definition: Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it). And this gets less accurate when you put it into English. Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not. Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example. \u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044] Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d. You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem. The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually. Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you.","title":"What exactly do you mean by \u201cfalse associations\u201d?"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-people-find-it-hard-to-go-monolingual","text":"Two reasons: They don\u2019t know the words.

If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it. The idea here is, when you are looking up stuff, it is inevitable you are going to remember some things but forget others, so when you go back and read/watch it again, you mine all the words you failed to remember the first time. You may think, \u201cI probably don\u2019t need those words though\u201d. Wrong. Yes you do.

Second, we want to remove any and all scan delays because we will be making heavy use of this extension and wouldn't want to be slowed down by anything. Now we will enable scanning within pop-ups, this is very important, as we want to be able to look up any words we don't know within a definiton. You may want to increase the size of your Yomichan pop up window because by default it is pretty small and will become a hindrance when using monolingual dictionaries. To make enough headroom to use Yomichan dictionaries comfortably we are going to edit the following settings. Here's how our pop up looks now: Next, if you want, you don't need to but I recommend it, enable automatic audio playback, so we know how to pronounce a word correctly the moment we look it up. Also add the extra audio source because surprisingly it adds extra audio! You can also add the Forvo audio source in Yomichan. See Yomichan Setup Tutorial for more info. Update December 2021: You should also add a text replacement rule for words with kanji repetition marks, they usually do not appear in monolingual dictionaries unless you repeat the kanji itself.

It is important you learn how to read Japanese. Often you get people asking \"Well can I learn Japanese without learning how to read it?\". You can, provided you don't want to understand basic grammar and have a tiny vocabulary size after years of study. With that said, it may seem difficult to learn how to read, after all there are like so much unique kanji on the page! Well yes, reading for the first time will always be painful, you just have to get through it and over time you will become more confident and better at reading. And if anyone is curious on how on earth you're supposed to find out how to read Japanese words and what they mean, just read on, there are certain tools that let you do this easily. Before you start reading for real, it is important you have already worked through a pre-made Anki deck, such as Tango N5+N4 or Core3k and also a grammar guide such as Tae Kim or Cure Dolly, this is to make the process less painful as there will be more words you know. Second, I recommend also having prior listening immersion experience because 1. it prevents you from developing a bad accent and 2. it helps you parse sentences better when reading. Key Points \u00b6 Learning to read will always be painful in the start. You shouldn't wait \"until you're ready\" because you will never be ready until you start reading. It is not recommended you start reading without prior listening experience. I recommend that you have a feel of what the language sounds like before trying to reproduce the sounds yourself in your head (which is what you're doing when you are reading) Don't worry about not comprehending a sentence no matter how many times you read it, in other words, learn to tolerate ambiguity . Things will become clearer as you read more. If you hate reading books in general, you can always play visual novels or read manga, both of which are very good for reading. Your first light novel/book whatever will always be the most painful. Get through it no matter how painful it is or how long is takes you. Don't rush yourself. Take your time. Go at your own pace. You wouldn't want to burnout and end up never reading again or anything. Learning how to read \u00b6 As mentioned earlier, make sure you have an adequate vocabulary size (say, you've finished a starter Anki deck) and a grasp of Japanese grammar before reading, this will make things much easier. Japanese subtitles \u00b6 Japanese subtitles are a good way to introduce yourself to reading, trying to read the subtitles can be challenging but fun, and it will also increase your comprehension of the show you're watching. Certain tools let you easily look up words in a dictionary. I recommend you use the Anacreon MPV Script paired with Yomichan . Manga \u00b6 Manga is probably the best way to get into reading without it being too intimidating as the way its written is similar to spoken Japanese, and assuming you're already quite familiar with that, it won't be much of a trouble getting used to. And if you're not yet familiar, you'll be familiar after reading manga and watching anime in Japanese. Manga: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (yeah... as you can tell I'm not a manga reader) As you can see, manga uses all 3 writing systems, hiragana, katakana and kanji, therefore manga can be a great way to practice your skills in all 3 fields. But how about looking up words? That's literally a picture isn't it? There's a new program called Poricom that makes looking up words in manga much easier. You can find it here For Android users you can use OCR Manga Reader . For iOS users you can use Kantan Manga Reader Expect manga to be pretty hard for you at first, but over time it will smoothen out and get easier. You just need to read more. You just need to read a lot. Novels/Light Novels \u00b6 Even if you read like 100 manga, you still need to read novels since there will be words you still won't know a lot of words that are commonly used in written text. Literary Japanese is not that hard as it sounds, it's only slightly different from spoken Japanese and will be easy to get used to. For reading light novels, I recommend using Yomichan , you can find a detailed Yomichan setup tutorial [here] I seriously recommend you read novels on this site: Itazuraneko Old Library , sort by kanji count, usually 1,000-1,600 kanji count is a good, this just means how long the book is if you actually look at it. If you have an Android you should use Typhon Reader or Typhon\u6539 if the other one does not work with your phone. There are little buttons you can click on the itazuraneko old library to download epubs to load into it. You can also visit the full epub list but warning: you need a good phone to load that page because there are a LOT of books! If you cannot find the book you want on Itazuraneko you can try looking on Boroboro . iOS users can just use the Books app with epub files. Your first light novel will be extremely painful, but your second light novel won't be as painful. Expect a light novel to take a 1-3 months to finish reading when you're first starting out, it will get quicker overtime (I can finish a light novel in around 10 hours). Just read more, read a lot.

There is no doubt about it. \"Read more\" is often the first piece of Japanese learning advice that advanced learners of Japanese will give to any beginner, and for good reason. This article aims to give you tips and talk about worries that you may have when reading. Reading Tips \u00b6 I am JUST starting out, what should I do? \u00b6 Just starting out = don't know Japanese? See UsagiSpoon . Noob friendly reading practice = anime with Japanese subtitles, it's described in UsagiSpoon Or maybe just starting out = \"I have been learning Japanese for a while with [x] method, and I want to start reading for real! What should I do?\" Then read the rest of the article. Are visual novels better for beginners? \u00b6 Visual novels are better for beginners because they don't have to rely on a lot more descriptive text in order to create a story because visual novels have pictures on the screen, etc. Visual novels also help you make sense out of hard to understand texts due to images on the screen and more obvious contexts. They are easier to approach than novels, difficulty-wise, and therefore they are perfect for easing yourself into reading. See my visual novel guide to learn how to learn Japanese with visual novels. Yomichan + Textractor + Texthooker page \u00b6 The holy trinity of Japanese learning (for visual novel enjoyers). Everything you need to know is in The VN guide Read a book of something you've seen. \u00b6 Did you know many people become readers (in their native language) because they read the book of a movie they liked or something? Learning how to visualize scenes in your head is a different skill than just \"being native.\" You can apply the same exact strategy to Japanese. And it's the strategy that I recommend everyone take when they get into reading. Read the light novel series of an anime you enjoyed. Read the novel after you watch the anime, or even while watching the anime. And after you've seen the anime, still refer to the anime to help you read. Anyway, this is obviously a God tier reading strategy because, by watching the anime, you have given context to the text on the page, which translates into i+1 Krashen approved effective language learning gains, and the light novel will have multiple volumes, which is great for learners because getting used to one author's writing style is easier than reading a different author every time. Yomichan, Itazuraneko, EPUBs+\u30c3\u30c4 Reader \u00b6 The holy trinity of Japanese learning (for novel enjoyers). Set up Yomichan here Itazuraneko in Resources EPUBs... many ways you can get them. ( Itazuraneko ebook list , Kindle 1.19 for Windows+ UnpackKindleS , PeepoHappyBooks ) \u30c3\u30c4 Reader Manga \u00b6 Manga is good reading practice. Of course it is, there is no way it can't be. But you should kind of be aware that they only have speech and short descriptions most of the time. Nevertheless, they are still good for reading, and you can obviously learn tons of words from manga, and you'll get good at reading manga by reading a lot of manga. Yomichan, Mokuro, and a good OCR \u00b6 The holy trinity of Japanese learning (for manga enjoyers). Pomodoro / Timeboxing \u00b6 This is another God tier strategy that I'd like to introduce to you. The Pomodoro method requires you to focus on a task for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes), after which the timer rings and you take a short (5-minute) break. So you will be reading in 25 minute sessions. It doesn't really sound like much, but it is actually a very useful method. I usually drink water, get up, or walk around during break times; it helps to get refreshed before reading again. Here's the Pomodoro timer that I use. Pomofocus.io The default settings are 25 minutes of focus, a 5 minute short break, and a 15 minute long break. However, I feel like the 25 minutes are too much, so I recommend 20 minutes instead. You can click Setting at the top to change this. Also, I recommend you turn on Auto Start Breaks and Pomodoros. The act of making reading a habit \u2014 baby steps! \u00b6 You aren't going to become a crazy reader seen at the top of TheMoeWay's Discord reading leaderboard overnight. You need to make reading a habit; read in amounts that are manageable for you every day. And overtime, when you do this every day, it will become a habit, and you may feel like reading without thinking about \"time to improve my Japanese,\" because reading every single day will become a normal thing for you. Setting yourself goals every day \u00b6 Setting yourself a goal that you can reach everyday is an amazing way to keep up motivation to read every day. Try to find a concrete goal for yourself. Try to read for how long you are willing to read for the day, and then check how many characters (if it's a digital novel or visual novel) or pages (if it's manga or physical novel) you managed to read. Then take that amount of characters or pages and increase it by a bit (round it up or something) and make that your goal to read every day. The usefulness of grammar study and some specific Yomichan dictionaries. \u00b6 Honestly grammar study is very useful for reading. If you haven't studied a lot of grammar and don't know all JLPT N5, N4, N3, N2 and N1 grammar points, then I highly recommend you study them. But I don't mean this to say \"study JLPT grammar before reading.\" I mean, \"study JLPT grammar to improve your reading, which you should be doing, probably right about now\" I want you to watch Cure Dolly's playlist (your basic fundamentals) then study JLPT grammar with medamayaki's JLPT grammar deck . Listen, I don't care if JLPT grammar is not \"actually grammar.\" They are useful to study because they are phrases and structures in Japanese that have a rather ambiguous meaning just from the words alone, so you are likely to miss them in immersion. You really can't go wrong studying JLPT grammar. Now, the Yomichan dictionaries I really want you to use are: EVERY GRAMMAR ONE \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178 Your favorite monolingual dictionary. (if you dont have a favourite then use either one of my favourites: \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e03\u7248\u3001\u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248 (doesn't work with Anki, btw.) or \u65fa\u6587\u793e\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u5341\u4e00\u7248) If you can't understand monolingual dictionaries yet, still keep them because if you ever get stuck on what a word actually means, the monolingual dictionary will come through. My Comprehension Tip \u00b6 This is a tip for more experienced learners This is the only comprehension tip that actually works for me. The trick is to focus on nouns (and numbers). I came up with the idea when I noticed that when I read in English, the nouns stand out. Nouns are names, people, objects, places, etc. I felt like there was some type of word hierarchy. Any nouns/numbers \u2192 \"action\" verbs \u2192 adjectives \u2192 \"abstract\" verbs. And of course, within nouns, there is also a noun hierarchy, with names, pronouns, and physical objects at the top. I noticed that when I read Japanese, it feels a lot more hazy because my brain just doesn't make the nouns stand out more than adjectives or verbs. I started to \"focus\" (I hate to use this term because that's not what I am actually doing, it's more like noticing) on the nouns in sentences and noticed how my comprehension skyrocketed without losing speed. It can be a little tricky to notice nouns every time they come up, but trust me, this is an S-tier strategy, and all you need is practice. Comprehension Tip: Bilingual vs Monolingual: The difference between not knowing what's going on and actually understanding? \u00b6 In many cases, yes. Bilingual definitions can be too ambiguous sometimes, so it is always best to check the monolingual dictionary. Reading nayamigoto (aka: stuff you worry too much about) \u00b6 How many words you should I look up? \u00b6 I don't know because I was looking up every single thing since the beginning, and I think it worked out fine? Yomichan makes everything so easy. If I had to use copy paste into external apps or write out the word or even worse, use a physical dictionary then I would probably not look up many words. But YOU are living in 2023. YOU have Yomichan. Take advantage of it. Install a frequency dictionary (I recommend JPDB) so you can see what words are actually common. Below 10,000 frequency is a sign that it comes up a lot in books and anime. Reading Speed \u00b6 I'm just going to go out and say this right now. You will only get faster at reading by reading more. You are only able to read at the speed you are reading at right now because that is the speed someone, who has read the amount you have and the material you have, would be reading at in a perfectly normal situation. READING SPEED TIPS AND TRICKS \u00b6 I have some breaking news for you... the best way to increase your reading speed is to read more. But let me explain the magic behind it and the magic behind reading speed. Reading speed is comprehension. When you read more, you will comprehend more. Do not be worrying about reading speed if you don't already understand a lot/know all of the words in most books! Q: Should I read a lot of manga if I want to improve my Wikipedia reading speed? \u00b6 A: No. Specialization is required to get faster at reading at what you want. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1 \u00b6 Type 1: \"I have been staring at this sentence/paragraph/word/thing for ages and I have no idea what it is saying.\" Solution? The obvious thing to do is to look up the words and grammar used in the sentence, and also refer to the context (read previous lines). But what if you've already done that but still don't understand? The simple answer is to read more. Because comprehension is a gradual process. The factors that go into \"comprehending/understanding\" are much more broad than \"knowing the word\" and \"having studied the grammar.\" When you read more, you will see words used in many, many different contexts. And it is through your exposure to these words in various contexts that you will learn to comprehend more sentences. As much as I don't like to admit it, there is another way of training comprehension too. And that is by analyzing the sentence by referring to grammar points, dictionary definitions, example sentences, HiNative and Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b answers, etc. If you have the drive to do all of that, then I'd say you can't go wrong with that, but at the same time, there is no way you aren't improving by just reading more, so I would say this decision is all on you. Perhaps learning to balance analyzing with just reading more is a useful skill to have. Anyway, the ultimate solution is to try your best and read more. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1.5 \u00b6 Type 1.5: \"I have type 1 comprehension anxiety. I absolutely despise not understanding, I want to understand everything. I am a high believer in analyzing sentences. But how much should I actually do it?\" And as a high believer in reading more and an ex-high believer in analyzing sentences, I'd say there is only so much comprehension you can get out of analyzing unfamiliar sentences; the learner that has read a ton will understand a lot more than the learner that just analyzes everything. Analyzing is by no means bad; I just think you should do it in moderation because reading more sentences will benefit you more than hyperfocusing on the same one. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1.5 Variation 2 \u00b6 Variation 2: \"But wouldn't analyzing everything make me improve faster!\" In my experience, it is nearly inevitable that you'll have the urge to analyze everything. After all, it seems like a very good reading strategy, and it is, to a certain extent. There are books I read 3 times (Volumes 1-3 of \u9f8d\u30f6\u5b22\u4e03\u3005\u3005\u306e\u57cb\u8535\u91d1 each 3 times) and then some because I was doing sentence cards and mined unknown words from the books with their sentences, so I ended up reading the same sentences over and over again. I analyzed the crap out of those books. And guess what? When I went back and read those books after reading a lot of other books, I realized how much I had missed . This goes back to the whole \"the person that reads a lot will understand more than the person that analyzes the same stuff.\" You will come across a ton of sentences in a ton of contexts when you read more, and you'll improve a lot when doing so. Now back to the question, would it make you improve faster than \"just reading\" more? Hard to say, but when reading, I always thought about what I was reading. I always thought about the meaning of what I was reading. I felt like everyone did this though, but sometimes you end up reading words without thinking about their meaning, which is another question I'd like to answer. Q: What should I do when I end up reading words without thinking about their meaning? \u00b6 I think in every book they have those useless/less important lines, right? I think it is perfectly fine not to think too deeply about them. And there are lines that make you want to stop reading sometimes, right? I think it's fine if you don't think deeply about them either. However everything else is a matter of a few different factors. There's comprehension, focus, and fatigue. With really hard sentences, it is very common to end up reading the words without taking in the meaning. Read the sentence again 2 times. If you don't understand it after that, it is way above your ability, and you should just move on. I know I sound like a broken record, but I'll say it again, you get better at reading harder sentences by reading more because you see words used in tons of different contexts. Losing focus when reading is actually a thing. And getting fatigued is also a thing. While I can't give much advice about maintaining focus other than getting rid of distractions, I can say fatigue happens at around 20 minutes of reading for me. After a Pomodoro break, I am able to read the same sentences with a new set of eyes. Anyway, here's what you shouldn't forget: Is it enjoyable? \u2190 This is the most important question. I am unable to draw an objective conclusion about analyzing everything vs. just reading, but what matters most is that you are having fun, being interested, and wanting to read. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 2 \u00b6 Type 2: \"When I am reading for a while, my brain turns to mush, and I read too fast, and things slip through my comprehension.\" Honest advice: I think you should just suck it up and read slower. Also, take breaks. I often have times where, after a break, I comprehend the same sentences more. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 3 \u00b6 Type 3: \"I can read all the words, I know all their meanings, but I can't visualize the scene! I don't understand what is actually going on! I have to analyze and even then I have no clue what is happening. What should I do?\" I know this is very hard for you, but here's what you need to do: Read more Q: Is that it? Come on! I'm sure there is something else I could do that would really improve my situation right now. \u00b6 A: Well everything boils down to \"read more.\" I answered with \"read more\" because the theory behind it is: Your comprehension lacks because the kinds of sentences you struggle with are ones you are unfamiliar with. In language acquisition, force feeding yourself too-unfamiliar sentences is not as effective as understanding i+1 sentences. (Only one thing in the sentence that aren't so comfortable with; these \"things\" may not even be identifiable.) When you read more, you will come across a crap ton of sentences , and within these sentences, there will be plenty of i+1 sentences, and this is the peak of your language acquisition gains. As a result of reading a lot, you'll improve your Japanese and find it easier to understand those difficult sentences. Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 4 \u00b6 Type 4: \"I've been studying for a while, with [x] method, I've learned [x] amount of words and grammar. However, when I try to read I don't know any of the words. Reading is a huge struggle. What should I do?\" I'm sure you can already anticipate the answer. Let me just go ahead and say it: It is impossible to get good at reading without reading. It is impossible to learn most of the words you need to a high degree of understanding just with Anki, without reading. There is nothing else you can be doing than reading more. Of course, you can study more grammar, and learn more vocab with Anki, which will of course help. But you will only get good at reading by reading more. The case for reading faster \u00b6 OK, in my experience, trying to make yourself read faster just makes you understand less. But we all want to be able to keep our comprehension whilst also reading faster, right? Yes, but you can only get to that level if you read a lot. If you a read a lot, you will end up reading sentences/words in clumps, right? I consciously made mental conceptualizations of parts of sentences in order to read them in clumps. This is just a fancy way of saying, \"This means [x] and there is no need to read word this for word. I'll keep a mental note/recognition of the fact that I can read this as a \"shape\" to get its meaning instead of reading it word for word\" Q: No subvocalization = no comprehension? \u00b6 In my experience, when the words/sentences you are choosing not to subvocalize are not that familiar to you (i.e., you cannot understand them just by glancing at them.) (An example that experienced readers should understand without reading it word for word is \u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044) then you will end up not understanding what it is actually saying. Subvocalizing is a useful reading technique, and most people do it; if you read a lot, your subvocalization will just get faster. So don't stop subvocalizing because you think it's slowing you down. It is not. The only things slowing you down are: You worrying too much about speed and character count, the fact that you haven't read enough, and the fact that it is pretty much common sense that you wouldn't be lightning fast at reading a text in a language you basically don't have much experience with when compared to a native. Reading more is the crux of increasing reading speed, so don't forget! I can't read! I am not a reader in my native lang! I am too dumb/adhd/young/bad memory to read! \u00b6 C O P E. And a cope I lived with until I realized all you need is a good book. And timeboxing. OK BUT how MUCH do I have to read??? \u00b6 It's a silly question because you never stop reading because you can always improve. But how much do you need to read in order to get really proficient, you may ask? I don't know the exact number, but after 300 novels, you would be pretty good. If you mine the entirety of 30 to 40 novels and use monolingual dictionaries, you will have a very large vocabulary and will understand a lot more from listening and so on. But knowing the words is only the beginning of being a proficient reader imo. Anyway, stop worrying about how much you need to read because it's a waste of time calculating how many books you need to read until you never look at text again.

Scale 100% Yomichan CSS INFO ABOUT THE FONT IM USING: IMPORTANT!!! Do not just blindly copy my CSS Let me explain. The font I use is MS Mincho. It is included in the Japanese language pack for Windows but you can get all the fonts we're gonna use here . Install them and restart your PC. MS Mincho is a \u660e\u671d\u4f53 font that is made to look good on every possible screen resolution. As a result the lines are thin, without setting a font-weight property. And also as a result, the font falls back to bitmap fallback mode when you are too zoomed out. I use a 1080p laptop, which means I am on 125% display scaling on a 1080p monitor. You will need to zoom in more than me to get the same results. Anyway, as a result of the CSS, assuming you have zoomed in properly and set font weight , your Japanese text will be incredibly crisp. The zoom is important and makes sense when you see my \u30c3\u30c4 reader setup. . gloss-content { font-family : MS Mincho , SimSun !important ; font-weight : 900 ; font-size : 19 px !important ; } . tag-label-content { font-family : MS Gothic , Microsoft YaHei !important ; font-weight : 400 ; font-size : 15 px !important ; } . kanji-gloss-content { font-family : MS Mincho , SimSun !important ; font-weight : 900 ; font-size : 16 px !important ; } . kanji-glpyh { font-family : kanji-stroke-orders , sans-serif !important ; font-size : 8.5 em !important ; } . headword { font-family : MS Mincho , SimSun !important ; font-weight : 900 ; font-size : 12 px !important ; } How it looks If it doesn't look like this, you did something wrong!!!!!!!!! \u30c3\u30c4 Reader Setup: Part 1 I have a confession to make. I am a \u6a2a\u66f8\u304d enjoyer. Because I mainly read on my computer and feel like my eyes move more naturally than they do when reading \u7e26\u66f8\u304d. I don't want to start a \u7e26\u66f8\u304d vs. \u6a2a\u66f8\u304d war, but as a personal preference, I like \u6a2a\u66f8\u304d. Step 1: Zoom in 140% if you have 125% display scaling (laptop). Probably 25% more if you have 100% display scaling (desktop). \u2190 VERY IMPORTANT Step 2: Theme: white background black text Step 3: Font families (both boxes): MS Mincho (see yomichan css for the reason and dl link) Step 4: Font size 21 Step 5: Line height 1.65 (I did everything with custom CSS which is in part 2 but I was lazy to change it) Step 6: Writing mode: Horizontal Step 7: Blur image: Off Step 8: Continuous viewing mode.

The default horizontal setup on \u30c3\u30c4 is TERRIBLE. In order to read with natural eye movement you need appropriate space between lines and optimal eye distance between lines. The CSS I made just makes the text easier to look at so I can read with no fatigue. How it looks If it doesn't look like this, there is something you did wrong! Mouse side buttons and tips I don't know about you, but I absolutely despise the default function of mouse side buttons being \"front\" and \"back\" I reconfigured them (in my mouse software) for the \"front\" one to be Alt Down , which is the Yomichan shortcut to jump to the next word in the scan results. I have the \"back\" button for Shift . This is so I can look up more comfortably. I KNOW that you can look up words with the mouse wheel, but I don't think it is as comfortable as using the side button mapped to Shift . Also you can hold the mouse in your lap instead of having your arm reached out all day. Also I often click the mouse wheel and scroll slowly when reading. It's just a habit at this point and I don't know if it's any better than just scrolling.

But let me explain the magic behind it and the magic behind reading speed. Reading speed is comprehension. When you read more, you will comprehend more.

The obvious thing to do is to look up the words and grammar used in the sentence, and also refer to the context (read previous lines). But what if you've already done that but still don't understand? The simple answer is to read more. Because comprehension is a gradual process. The factors that go into \"comprehending/understanding\" are much more broad than \"knowing the word\" and \"having studied the grammar.\" When you read more, you will see words used in many, many different contexts. And it is through your exposure to these words in various contexts that you will learn to comprehend more sentences. As much as I don't like to admit it, there is another way of training comprehension too. And that is by analyzing the sentence by referring to grammar points, dictionary definitions, example sentences, HiNative and Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b answers, etc. If you have the drive to do all of that, then I'd say you can't go wrong with that, but at the same time, there is no way you aren't improving by just reading more, so I would say this decision is all on you. Perhaps learning to balance analyzing with just reading more is a useful skill to have. Anyway, the ultimate solution is to try your best and read more.","title":"Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1"},{"location":"readingtips/#comprehension-nayamigoto-type-15","text":"Type 1.5: \"I have type 1 comprehension anxiety. I absolutely despise not understanding, I want to understand everything. I am a high believer in analyzing sentences. But how much should I actually do it?\" And as a high believer in reading more and an ex-high believer in analyzing sentences, I'd say there is only so much comprehension you can get out of analyzing unfamiliar sentences; the learner that has read a ton will understand a lot more than the learner that just analyzes everything. Analyzing is by no means bad; I just think you should do it in moderation because reading more sentences will benefit you more than hyperfocusing on the same one.","title":"Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1.5"},{"location":"readingtips/#comprehension-nayamigoto-type-15-variation-2","text":"Variation 2: \"But wouldn't analyzing everything make me improve faster!\" In my experience, it is nearly inevitable that you'll have the urge to analyze everything. After all, it seems like a very good reading strategy, and it is, to a certain extent. There are books I read 3 times (Volumes 1-3 of \u9f8d\u30f6\u5b22\u4e03\u3005\u3005\u306e\u57cb\u8535\u91d1 each 3 times) and then some because I was doing sentence cards and mined unknown words from the books with their sentences, so I ended up reading the same sentences over and over again. I analyzed the crap out of those books. And guess what? When I went back and read those books after reading a lot of other books, I realized how much I had missed . This goes back to the whole \"the person that reads a lot will understand more than the person that analyzes the same stuff.\" You will come across a ton of sentences in a ton of contexts when you read more, and you'll improve a lot when doing so. Now back to the question, would it make you improve faster than \"just reading\" more? Hard to say, but when reading, I always thought about what I was reading. I always thought about the meaning of what I was reading. I felt like everyone did this though, but sometimes you end up reading words without thinking about their meaning, which is another question I'd like to answer.","title":"Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1.5 Variation 2"},{"location":"readingtips/#q-what-should-i-do-when-i-end-up-reading-words-without-thinking-about-their-meaning","text":"I think in every book they have those useless/less important lines, right? I think it is perfectly fine not to think too deeply about them. And there are lines that make you want to stop reading sometimes, right? I think it's fine if you don't think deeply about them either. However everything else is a matter of a few different factors. There's comprehension, focus, and fatigue. With really hard sentences, it is very common to end up reading the words without taking in the meaning. Read the sentence again 2 times. If you don't understand it after that, it is way above your ability, and you should just move on. I know I sound like a broken record, but I'll say it again, you get better at reading harder sentences by reading more because you see words used in tons of different contexts. Losing focus when reading is actually a thing. And getting fatigued is also a thing. While I can't give much advice about maintaining focus other than getting rid of distractions, I can say fatigue happens at around 20 minutes of reading for me. After a Pomodoro break, I am able to read the same sentences with a new set of eyes. Anyway, here's what you shouldn't forget: Is it enjoyable? \u2190 This is the most important question. I am unable to draw an objective conclusion about analyzing everything vs. just reading, but what matters most is that you are having fun, being interested, and wanting to read.","title":"Q: What should I do when I end up reading words without thinking about their meaning?"},{"location":"readingtips/#comprehension-nayamigoto-type-2","text":"Type 2: \"When I am reading for a while, my brain turns to mush, and I read too fast, and things slip through my comprehension.\" Honest advice: I think you should just suck it up and read slower.

In language acquisition, force feeding yourself too-unfamiliar sentences is not as effective as understanding i+1 sentences. (Only one thing in the sentence that aren't so comfortable with; these \"things\" may not even be identifiable.) When you read more, you will come across a crap ton of sentences , and within these sentences, there will be plenty of i+1 sentences, and this is the peak of your language acquisition gains. As a result of reading a lot, you'll improve your Japanese and find it easier to understand those difficult sentences.","title":"Q: Is that it? Come on!

However, when I try to read I don't know any of the words. Reading is a huge struggle. What should I do?\" I'm sure you can already anticipate the answer. Let me just go ahead and say it: It is impossible to get good at reading without reading. It is impossible to learn most of the words you need to a high degree of understanding just with Anki, without reading. There is nothing else you can be doing than reading more. Of course, you can study more grammar, and learn more vocab with Anki, which will of course help.

Subvocalizing is a useful reading technique, and most people do it; if you read a lot, your subvocalization will just get faster. So don't stop subvocalizing because you think it's slowing you down. It is not. The only things slowing you down are: You worrying too much about speed and character count, the fact that you haven't read enough, and the fact that it is pretty much common sense that you wouldn't be lightning fast at reading a text in a language you basically don't have much experience with when compared to a native.","title":"Q: No subvocalization = no comprehension?"},{"location":"readingtips/#i-cant-read-i-am-not-a-reader-in-my-native-lang-i-am-too-dumbadhdyoungbad-memory-to-read","text":"","title":"I can't read!

You may find this useful if you don't already know. DJT Kana - A simple kana recognition game. You may want to enable all the hiragana, and katakana and the combinations in order to properly test your skills. It also features a \"play sound\" button, which I recommend you make use of. Kanji \u00b6 Important Note: Reading a lot is the best way to learn kanji. This means you should learn kanji through learning to read words. However, you can seek alternatives below if you keep forgetting how to read words you come across, or if you want to learn how to write.* \u203b - The \"Kanken Deck\" - The best way to learn how to write when you can already read. Chronopolize's Kanji Components - An Anki deck to help you differentiate similar kanji by teaching components.

Tango Decks You are advised to do Tango over \"Core\" decks because Tango is easier, as it uses the sentence card format. However you may want to create a \"mining deck\" when you complete Tango N4. Core2.3K VN Order Deck - the Core deck but ordered in terms of visual novel frequency. Not recommended for beginners. You may want to use this if you have studied Japanese before and are deciding on changing your method. Grammar \u00b6 \u203b - Cure Dolly\u2019s Organic Japanese - Cure Dolly is a new grammar guide that has sparked recent attention because of its unique way of teaching Japanese grammar. It aims to teach Japanese grammar in a way that sticks true to the roots of the language, in contrast to other grammar guides that take shortcuts that could cause confusion later on. For that reason, I recommend you start with this. Because of Cure Dolly's speech, and the audio quality presented in the videos, you may find it difficult to understand. However there are subtitles available for all videos that may alleviate this issue, which I recommend you turn on. Cure Dolly Complete Transcript by dinuz - A transcript of a few Cure Dolly videos. This can be useful when you want to check something or would just prefer to read it. Tae Kim\u2019s Guide to Japanese, a guide for grammar - Tae Kim's grammar guide has been around for as long as anyone can remember. It is often recommended as a good grammar guide however you may want to use Cure Dolly instead, for a more optimized approach. Reference list of all Japanese grammar patterns. - Very useful for referring to a point. \"Making Sense of Japanese - What The Textbooks Don't Tell You\" by Jay Rubin - similar to Cure Dolly, it's like the equivalent of the first few videos. It dispells common misconceptions about Japanese grammar people have due to studying Japanese grammar the \"traditional\" way. NihongoKyoshi JLPT grammar - JLPT \"grammar\" taught in Japanese. I recommend most people learn these after Cure Dolly/Tae Kim. You should learn these because many of the grammar points can be easily overlooked when seen in the wild if you don't already know them. \u203b - NihongoKyoshi Anki Deck - Highly recommended. It only has Japanese definitions, an intentional choice in order to avoid false associations of Japanese grammar with English words.

It aims to teach Japanese grammar in a way that sticks true to the roots of the language, in contrast to other grammar guides that take shortcuts that could cause confusion later on. For that reason, I recommend you start with this. Because of Cure Dolly's speech, and the audio quality presented in the videos, you may find it difficult to understand. However there are subtitles available for all videos that may alleviate this issue, which I recommend you turn on. Cure Dolly Complete Transcript by dinuz - A transcript of a few Cure Dolly videos. This can be useful when you want to check something or would just prefer to read it.

It is often recommended as a good grammar guide however you may want to use Cure Dolly instead, for a more optimized approach.

It dispells common misconceptions about Japanese grammar people have due to studying Japanese grammar the \"traditional\" way. NihongoKyoshi JLPT grammar - JLPT \"grammar\" taught in Japanese. I recommend most people learn these after Cure Dolly/Tae Kim. You should learn these because many of the grammar points can be easily overlooked when seen in the wild if you don't already know them. \u203b - NihongoKyoshi Anki Deck - Highly recommended.

This guide was made to be followed in order. Most of the decisions have already been made for you. The routines are split into days. Each day has tasks that you need to do. What you'll expect to know at the end of the 30 days: An understanding of the most common Japanese grammar patterns A vocabulary of at least 500 words. An understanding of basic sentences in slice of life anime. The ability to read hiragana, katakana and some common kanji. A good foundation to continue learning Japanese on your own. What I expect from you: the will to learn 3+ hours of your free time per day available for Japanese. a computer (sorry phone users) Day 1 \u00b6 Stage: Starting kana stage \u00b6 The absolute first thing you need to do when you learn Japanese is to learn the kana. Kana is short for hiragana and katakana. Why and how they are used can get confusing for newcomers to Japanese. So, I recommend reading [this] . Read it until you get to finish the Hiragana and Katakana section, just before the \"Kanji\" section. It is quite a hefty amount of text. It could take some time. By the way you aren't memorizing the kana with that link. I will explain how you will do that below. When you are done reading that, copy out the chart from the main guide . It is important you learn how to write kana as this can also make it easier to differentiate them too. Don't worry if your handwriting is not pretty. You can do it on a paper or a screen, it doesn't matter really. Then, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wZHqOghvSs It is a video by JapanesePod. This should probably be the only Japanese Pod video you should watch though, just sayin'. Now, go on this website. https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html Click \"show/hide options\" Click \"check all\" for the categories (Hiragana, Hiragana combinations, Katakana, Katakana combinations). Don't worry about the fonts. Type the correct romaji in the text box. This is how you'll practice your kana. Do this for 10 minutes. You can use this timer here: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ Day 2 \u00b6 Stage: Creating your own Japan at home \u00b6 Practice on this site https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes. Timer here: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ . Do not forget that all kana must be enabled. Surrounding your daily life with Japanese is the most important part of the immersion method. It may be hard to decide, but you'll need to find content that interests you and you'll need to make consuming it a habit. Slice of life is a good place to start. There are many, many anime that have simple Japanese. Here are some suggestions (but you can use anything you want): Love Live! (Any) Non Non Biyori Kimetsu no Yaiba Koe no Katachi Hotarubi no Mori e Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo Himouto! Umaru-chan Nakitai Watashi wa Neko o Kaburu Yuru Yuri Precure (Any) Gabriel Dropout Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight K-on Ao haru Ride Usagi Drop Flying Witch Byousoku 5 Centimeter Kiniro Mosaic New Game See Anime Resources for places to find anime. Downloading the anime is preferred because it makes it easier to bring the anime portably. Q: Everything here is so boooooring!!!! I'd rather watch something actually good! A: And I like your way of thinking! Immersion is all about spending time with content that interests you. So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions. Your task: I want you to try immersing for the first time with the \"subtitle tutor\" method. The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an anime with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier). The flowchart process: Watch with English subtitles Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening) Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.) Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input. While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand. Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of. Becoming able to understand Japanese is a skill that takes a long time. But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible. The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to. I also recommend listening to the audio when doing other things. By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said. Note: Listening while doing other things = passive immersion . Listening with undivided attention = active immersion . Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study? A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Japanese and get a deeper feel for the language. Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now? A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch. Roll a dice I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow. Day 3 \u00b6 Stage: Just starting grammar \u00b6 Do your daily kana practice on this site! https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes. Use a timer here: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ Now here's where you'll start grammar. You don't need to do any drills or anything. You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that. Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion. The grammar guide I want you to use is Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese. The YouTube playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj For folks out there that prefer reading, here is the Cure Dolly fan-made textbook ! All I want you to do is watch the videos and take notes (Google Keep note taking site here: https://keep.google.com/ ) Note: I recommend turning on the subtitles for Cure Dolly's videos. Watch 3 videos a day That is a good number, you will be near the end of her guide after 30 days at that pace. Take notes. Q: What should I even put in my notes? A: You should put information that you feel is important. Rely on your instincts. If Cure Dolly says this means that, then you might want to take a note of it. Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone. Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes. Q: Why should I even do notes! I can probably remember everything anyway! A: I want you to take notes so you can go over them whenever you need to. (Keyword: when you need to!) You are essentially making your own little mini version of the videos in your notes. So, if you do forget something, you can always just look at your notes. Q: I really don't want to take notes... A: And that is fine! Note-taking is an area where I do think personal preference is involved. Stage: Just done your first grammar lessons \u00b6 After you watched your first 3 Cure Dolly videos, you can consider that your \"grammar session done for the day\". Now what I want you to do is immerse. You know the drill. Roll a 4-sided dice Q: Do I need to do the \"subtitle tutor\" method? A: The subtitle tutor method is not required . It is merely a way to make immersion more interesting in the beginning. I merely presented it to you as a method that is available to you. Q: What do I do if I keep hearing a word that interests me and want to know what it means? A: First of all, that's great! You can use Jisho.org to search up the word. There's a chance you might be mishearing it so you may not be able to find out. Tomorrow will get more complex. So, uh, look forward to it...? Day 4 \u00b6 Stage: Learning kanji and new words: Using Anki for the first time. \u00b6 Today you'll be: Practicing kana Studying grammar Using Anki for the first time Learning new words and kanji in Anki. Setting up a Japanese keyboard on your pc Doing your daily immersion. It is a lot. Please make sure you have enough time today. Practice your kana on this site https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes. 10 Minute Timer Here After that, do your daily grammar study. Remember the routine from the previous day: 3 Cure Dolly videos ! After you've done that, let's set up Anki. First, I want you to watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI Now let's download Anki. You can download Anki by visiting the official website ( here ) and clicking on the Download button. It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option. Download the required deck here When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the \"interface language selector\". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine. Go into Tools on the top bar, and click Preferences (Ctrl+P) . In this window, click on the Scheduling tab, and check (\u2713) the option \" V3 Scheduler \". And change the Learn ahead limit to 900 . Now click Close. In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button Import File is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck. Once clicked, it should open the file picker window. Choose your downloaded deck. When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok. Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it. The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day. 20 cards is the default. 20 cards may or not be manageable. You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now. Click the cog icon next to the Core2.3k Version 3 deck. Click Options . Change Maximum reviews/day to 9999 . This just means \"uncapped\". The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but, It is good practice to uncap your review limit. Just some Anki know-how. You also need to change the Learning steps to 1m 5m 10m . Change Insertion order , to Sequential (oldest cards first) Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to 10m . Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews . Now click Save . I also want you to install the Speed Focus Mode Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now. Click on Tools at the top of Anki, and click Add-ons . Click Get Add-ons... . Paste this code into the box: 1046608507 and click OK . You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up. Click the cog icon next to the Core2.3k Version 3 deck. Hold the Shift key and click Options . A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold Shift while clicking Options ). In the General tab, there are a few settings you need to change. Change Automatically play alert to 10 seconds. Change Automatically show answer to 15 seconds. Change Automatically rate 'again' to 60 seconds. Now let's get to studying the deck. When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking Study now First thing you'll notice.... There's a word you can probably read... \"\u3059\u308b\"... (IF THE WORD IS NOT \u3059\u308b THEN YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR CARD INSERTION ORDER!) But there is also line below it with absolutely CRAZY kanji.... Ignore that! Only focus on the top line. That's what you actually need to learn. The line below it is just an example sentence. I can't say it's very useful at this point. But everything in this deck is insanely common. Now I want you to read this carefully, What you are actually being tested for is, whether or not you can read the word and ALSO know what it means. In Japanese learning we call this \"learning the reading and meaning \" For a word like, \u3059\u308b, the reading is easy. It's just \u3059\u308b! It isn't in kanji. The next word \u8a00\u3046, does use kanji though. When you click Show answer at the bottom (shortcut: Space ), you can see what the word means. This deck also other interesting features. A picture at the back. Audio at the back. The picture illustrates the example sentence. It is not important. There is also a sentence translation at the bottom. Scroll down if you can't see it. Wait a second. You might have been wondering. Why can't I even see the word in the example sentence it is supposed to be in? The reason is, it is actually there, it is just inflected. Inflections are something you will learn from Cure Dolly. These inflections are absolutely CRAZY for you right now, so do not worry about learning inflections from this deck. The example sentences are too advanced for you. When you learn a word in Japanese, you learn its \"base\" form. This means its un-inflected form. Wait a second. So, what do you actually do from here? Well, you see that white line at the top going through the card? That is the separator between the \"front\" and the \"back\" of the card. The first line on the back of the card is the Reading . The second line on the back of the card is the Meaning . Those are the 2 pieces of information that you must remember. Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else. Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself. Think of Again as \"I FAILED\". Easy as SUPER EASY, Good as normal/usual/eh, and Hard as \"I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right\". Because this is a card that is seen for the first time , press \"Again\". When seeing \"unseen cards\" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing Again . This will send the card to the \"Learning\" pile. You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1? The red number is the learning pile. Blue: New pile Red: Learning pile Green: Review pile The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. Getting a \"Good\" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in x number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards). When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated. Do not spend a long time looking at the same card When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it. So, the purpose of the Speed Focus Mode add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card. My card learning method Step 1: Look at the card. Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not. Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card. Step 4: Read the reading. Step 5: Read the meaning. Step 6: Let the audio play. Step 7: For now, press \"Again\" Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but... Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge. Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading. Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning. Only 1 meaning is enough. Step 12: I reveal the back. Step 13: I grade myself depending on if the meaning and reading I thought it was, was correct. Step 14: I usually use the Good button if I got it correct. Again if it wasn't correct. After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day. The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards! Please make sure you do Anki every day! Q: Why does UsagiSpoon recommend Core instead of Tango? A: Short answer: You learn more with Core. Core teaches a new word with each card. The order of words is optimized for anime and visual novels because it teaches the most common words from them. Tango on the other hand, has tons of cards that do not introduce new words, and repeats a lot of similar sentences. \u2190 IMO this is just inefficient. Tango also has weird English translations and stuff. While I was writing this day of UsagiSpoon I originally wrote the entire thing showing you how to use the Tango deck. But I had to point out \"Hey don't look at the translations!\", and \"There are a lot of words you will probably never see in anime...\" etc, etc. So in the end I saw how the Core deck was better and decided to use that. While Core is significantly more difficult (obviously! It is actually introducing something new with every single card) but it will benefit you more than using Tango. Q: Should I worry if I forget a lot? A: No. Anki is made for things you're likely to forget. You are very likely to forget words of a language you just started learning. I don't think it is strange if you forget more than half of what you learn when a day passes by. You're likely to forget these words without Anki, so that's why you need to keep Anki'ing them so you can finally learn the word. In other words, just keep doing Anki. If this continues for a while then you might want to think back on your method of doing Anki. Q: Leeches (Words not sticking) Leeches are when you keep forgetting the word no matter what. Memory works by picking up on cues. When words don't stick, it means there are multiple things in the wider scope of the word that makes it so your mind isn't picking on any cues. In easier terms, you need more, or different information than the information on the card. For these leeches, I recommend looking at them in example sentences. You can use Jisho.org with the #sentence tag to see example sentences with an English translation. Setting up a Japanese Keyboard Now let's set up a Japanese keyboard. Read this article: http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/ The article is very good. After you've done that lemme teach you the most useful functions. Alt ` (backquote)(the key left of 1): Switch from entering just letters like these to kana like this: \u304b\u306a. if you type \"kana\" when the symbol on the taskbar is an \"A\" it will just be \"kana\" but if the symbol is \u3042 then it will become \"\u304b\u306a\" Space : Conversion. When you want to type a kanji, you have to type its reading, and then use space to convert it. Due to Japanese's... japanesesiness, there are multiple conversion candidates for the kana you entered. Let's try a word you probably just learned, like \u8a00\u3046. To type that in kanji you have to switch to kana input mode (the \u3042 symbol) and type \u3044\u3046, then press space until \u8a00\u3046 is selected, and then press Enter . If you want to enter kana without converting, just type what you want and press enter. F7 : Katakana conversion. Win Space : Switch input methods (only effective if you have more than one input method (example English (UK) and Japanese (Japan) ) Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion. I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing. I recommend you decide on a set number of anime episodes to use for immersion per day. If you can't decide, then by all means, let a dice decide for you! Roll a 4-sided dice Day 5 \u00b6 Go on this site https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html and practice kana for 10 minutes. https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/ . Now do your daily Anki. Anki is tough in the beginning. But it gets better I promise! Your Anki today will be slightly different. You'll have a blue number AND a green number next to the deck. The green number is your reviews . Make sure you stay on top of your reviews! Important word of advice: If you ever become unable to keep up with piling reviews, then reduce your new cards per day limit! After you've done your Anki for the day, you should get onto your daily grammar study. 3 Cure Dolly videos! After that, it's just your daily immersion. Q: How many episodes will it be??? A: Roll a 4-sided dice Q: What should I be looking out for when listening? A: The sounds of it, the speaking patterns, the \"words\" that pop up a lot, the words that you learned, the grammar that you learned etc. Every little bit counts. Day 6 \u00b6 Stage: First ever reading practice: Japanese subtitles! \u00b6 Today you'll start reading practice for the first time! It is going to be quite tough. But don't worry if you don't understand it! Every bit counts! First, practice kana for 10 minutes. Kana Practice Site 10 Minute Timer After that, go on to doing your Anki. After your Anki, do your 3 Cure Dolly videos. Then let's get on to reading. Your first reading content will be anime with Japanese subtitles. It is kind of tricky to set it up, but let's go through it. First, you will need Yomichan. Click on this link to read my guide on it. After you have set up Yomichan, follow the rest of these steps. In your Chrome extension settings ( chrome://extensions ), enable \" Developer mode \" in the top right . Now download the asbplayer Extension It has to be installed manually; it is not on the Chrome Web Store. You need to unzip the .zip file first. Now you go in your Chrome extension settings and click \"Load unzipped\" Choose the unzipped folder. Restart your browser. Now you need to get subtitle files for the anime you want to watch. Let's just use... Love Live (2013) as an example. The site Kitsunekko has the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime. (NOTE: The site has a tendency of going down randomly. You can view a backup here ) I scrolled down to \"Love Live!\", and downloaded the \"Love Live! (01-13) (Webrip).zip\" file. After unzipping the file, I got a bunch of .SRT files. .SRT files are subtitle files. Now what you need to do is drag and drop an .SRT file onto a video. The asbplayer extension works with Aniwatch . I recommend streaming from there. Before you start playing an episode, make sure you have this page open: https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ When an episode starts playing, you can drag and drop an .SRT file onto it. The subtitles should load and work. English subtitles display at the same time, which is bad for learning because English subs can confuse you when you try to understand the actual Japanese structure behind the meaning. For just giving context to the audio, they are fine though. Anyway, to disable English subtitles, click the CC icon on the video player controls and click Off. By using Shift on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. But there is a problem. The subtitle file for Love Live is horribly out of sync ! This means the subtitles don't match the timing of the audio. Luckily, asbplayer supports adjusting the timing. You can do that with Ctrl Shift Left or Right . Sometimes it doesn't work if you don't click on the video first. You will need to experiment to find the right timing. For Love Live it was -8400ms. It might be hard to figure out what subtitle belongs to what audio when reading is so difficult. Sentences written in kana make it easier to tell which is which though. This page https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ displays the subtitles in a list. This makes it easier to go back to a line you missed. It only works if you had it open before loading the subtitle. This also enables you to \"read\" the anime! Which I recommend you do!!! So, what's the routine? Watch the anime with Japanese subtitles first. Then focus your attention on just reading it. Q: How many words do I look up? A: I think you should decide this using a 20-sided dice, per episode. Click here for 20-sided dice Roll! After you've looked up your amount just watch the rest with Japanese subs. If anything piques your interest, then feel free to look it up! Q: When watching with Japanese subs, do I try to read everything on the screen? A: No. I generally recommend looking up the number of words the dice decided and then just watch the rest of the episode without looking anything up or stopping to read anything, but you should focus on how the kana are pronounced etc. Q: When I look up something, or need to read something, do I pause the video? A: Yes! Pause the video when you need to look up! Q: What is the point of the subtitles in a list? A: You do it so you can do \"raw reading practice\". When the anime playing, you are doing half-reading half-listening. When you remove the audio part and just read the subtitles in a list, you are doing the equivalent of real reading! Q: Does the dice decide how many words I look up while watching the anime or while reading the subtitles in a list? A: Roll another 20 sided dice for when you read the anime. Q: How many episodes should I read? Focus on reading a single anime episode until you've looked up the amount of dice decided words. Q: Is it possible to understand everything by spending 30 minutes spamming Yomichan on a sentence? A: Short answer: No. Comprehension is a gradual process. Long answer: There are many things you will not understand just by using a dictionary. There are many factors that go into understanding something. There are obvious factors such as vocabulary and grammar. But there are also less obvious ones such as the contexts that that piece of language is often used in, which in turns leads to its meaning. In a vacuum, studying vocabulary and grammar increases your ability to understand things. But understanding the use of the vocabulary and grammar in contexts further increases your understanding of the sentence. This works especially well for sentences that have only one piece of language that you aren't comfortable with. This doesn't work well for hard sentences though. Because there is too much language information in the sentence that you are too unfamiliar with. The best you can do for hard sentences is to look up the vocabulary in them. While it may not be enough to understand that sentence at that time, your newly found knowledge of the word can help you connect it to some meaning in a later context. With more study and immersion (understanding things in context), your understanding of Japanese will increase. Q: Do I have to change the anime I'm reading to the one I last watched? No. I actually recommend reading the same one until you read the end. But you don't have to always use the same one if it no longer interests you. Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up? A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember. In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now. Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time. What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like \"Oh, right!\". And move on. Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Japanese has no spaces! A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner. You get better at it over time. Language learning is just pattern recognition after all. Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy. Q: Now that I can see the Japanese, can I try to translate it in my head? A: It's complicated... There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Japanese. The way of thinking is a lot different. That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion. Because Japanese is not English. You are advised to think of Japanese as Japanese. Be the language! You can do some sort of \"loose translation\", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning. Do I need to translate at all? Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.) It is also tiring, so do it in moderation. Q: How many episodes should I watch with Japanese subs until I go back to no subs? A: 1 Japanese subtitled episode per day is a good number. 2 or 3 if you want to go all out. Q: Should I watch Japanese subs or raw? A: They exist for different purposes. I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks. Japanese subs: Good: learn new words, reading practice Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio Raw: Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too. You will notice more than just watching with Japanese subtitles. Bad: the words you dont know you just don't know. Q: What about subtitle tutor? A: You shouldn't be doing it all the time. The only purpose is to give you an idea; context of what the audio is saying. It gets tedious watching the same episode twice too. Without watching the episode in Japanese after you watch it in English, there is no point. And using English subs as a crutch forever isn't a good idea. It just makes your immersion more effective in the beginning because immersion works better when you have an idea of what is going on . Getting rid of translations and training yourself to understand the language on its own is how you'll get better at Japanese in the future. Japanese subs are better because they give you the opportunity to learn the actual words that are being used in the anime. (Which is a lot of words, btw.) Day 7 \u00b6 Note about kana practice: Experience differs greatly from person to person. Some of you may already be comfortable with the kana after just 6 days. Others may need more practice. I think you should reduce the time spent on kana practice from 10 minutes to 5 minutes . You will be exposed to Japanese text a lot more going forward. Stage: Learning how to balance as a beginner. \u00b6 Your tasks for today are as follows. Step 1. Do your Anki. Step 2. Cure Dolly routine. Step 3. Immerse!! (Details below) Focusing on a particular area of your Japanese (e.g., listening or reading) is good. But how will you decide whether today is a day where you'll focus on listening or reading? For an advanced learner that can already read books and understand a lot of things, this is more obvious. But for a beginner, it can be tough to decide. The simple answer? Flip a coin . Heads = Listening day Tails = Reading day Day 8 \u00b6 Stage: The elephant in the room... kanji! \u00b6 Kanji look like scribbles, don't they? For a beginner, they look nonsensical. But for an experienced learner, they look like actual shapes and familiar faces. Every kanji can be broken down into fundamental shapes. Also known as radicals. Or \"primitives\" (term used in Remembering the Kanji). Example: \u840c = \u8279+\u65e5+\u6708 Example: \u8e0f = \u8db3+\u6c34+\u65e5 Example: \u8db3 = \u53e3+\u9fb0 Example: \u5c06 = \u4e2c+\u722b+\u5bf8 I recommend you do the \"Recognition Remembering the Kanji 450\" Anki deck. Download it here The purpose of the deck is to steadily give you the ability to see kanji as a combination of consistent shapes. Click the cog icon next to the \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e parent deck. Now click Options. There is a drop-down menu at the top of this window. Change Default to Recognition RTK . Change New cards/day to 10 Change the Learning steps to 1m 5m 10m . Change Insertion order , to Sequential (oldest cards first) Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to 10m . Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews . Click Save. When you click Study now, the first cards will be explanation cards. After you read them, and understood the usage of the deck, I recommend suspending them. You will be working on this deck alongside the Core deck. This deck will NOT help you read kanji. This deck will NOT help you write kanji from memory. This deck will NOT help you guess the meanings of words. This deck WILL help you see kanji as compositions of consistent shapes. It is an important skill to have, because when you are learning Japanese for a long time you will come across a ton of words and you may confuse them if the kanji look too similar for you. Q: So, what do I need to do today? Anki. Your Core deck and the RRTK deck. Grammar. Watch 3 Cure Dolly videos. Immersion. Q: Immersion...? Yes, you can do reading/watch with Japanese subs/raw listening/subtitle tutor. You can decide everything with a dice and flipping a coin if you're uncertain, of course. I apologize if \"immersion\" is a vague term. All of that stuff that you did with the anime and the subtitles and Yomichan is immersion. Day 9 \u00b6 Stage: Repetition starts to settle in \u00b6 Daily routine: Anki Grammar Immersion This is the fundamental process of the method. Keep doing what you're doing. But longer hours = more improvement! So, try and aim for longer immersion hours! Q: I've been thinking about looking up a lot of words in reading, is this bad or good? A: It's good! But please note if you make yourself look up a ton of words all the time, there is a risk of burning out and loss of enjoyment. This method relies on your consistency . To stay consistent, you need to make sure you're setting yourself manageable goals. Day 10 \u00b6 Daily routine: Anki Grammar Immersion You may want to look into Condensed Audio , this is a way to maximize the efficiency of passive listening. Passive listening is when you listen to Japanese audio when you are doing other things. While passive listening there are moments where you may be paying attention to the Japanese. Think of it as filling in the silence with Japanese. Or, listening to Japanese at every possible opportunity. Condensed audio removes non-speech parts of the audio, making it more efficient. If you have wireless earbuds, listening all the time becomes a lot easier. If you've been watching Love Live! (2013) , I made condensed audio for it a long while ago, which you can find here Day 11 \u00b6 Daily routine: Anki Grammar Immersion Q: MUST I do all my daily tasks in this exact order you have written? A: Nononono! Absolutely not. You can even do immersion first thing, or grammar first thing, or even Anki right at the end of the day. This is an area where people just have preferences and things that work better for them. Note: Just make sure you don't miss Anki! Day 12 \u00b6 Daily routine: Anki Grammar Immersion Yes, another day of immersing. Maybe day 12 can be Non-Non Biyori day. (Unless you've already immersed with it :P) Q: Can I listen to the same things over and over again? A: Absolutely! But if it gets boring, then switch to new content. Listening to the same content has huge benefits, but it can get boring and also you miss opportunities to hear new, useful things. Day 13 \u00b6 Daily routine: Anki Grammar Immersion Here's an interesting challenge for you today. Let today be a reading practice day. Look up 25 words in your Japanese subtitled anime reading practice. Day 14 \u00b6 Congratulations on making it this far! I know it has been tough (especially Anki and reading!), but the beginner stage is always the hardest part of learning any language, and things will only get easier the longer you do it. With more time spent doing the right methods, you'll certainly improve. You may have your doubts on what this method is actually doing, so allow me to explain. Your Anki ,\u3000 grammar study and looking up words is where you are increasing your knowledge of the language. Your listening and reading practice are where you are applying your knowledge , by getting exposure to how these parts of the language are used by natives. The subtitle tutor method aims to boost the comprehensibility of your listening immersion by giving you context of what is being said in the audio. Your Japanese subtitle listening helps you: associate kana with sounds, figure out what words are being said and ease you into reading. Your raw (no subs) listening practice is where you build a mental model of how the language actually sounds. This is good for a number of reasons. The main reasons being getting a good accent, and also being able to hear the words that you know. Listening isn't as clear as reading, it can be very fast and hard to keep up with. By getting used to raw listening you can train yourself to hear these unclear things better. When you get advanced at Japanese and understand your raw listening immersion, mass raw listening is the only way to get fluent. Your passive listening fills in the gaps where you otherwise wouldn't be doing Japanese. Stage: 100-page Yotsubato! challenge \u00b6 From today until the 30th day. I want you to challenge yourself to read 100 pages of the \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 manga. \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 is a great slice of life manga that features furigana (kana on the top of kanji). Manga are tricky to look up words on because they are essentially, text on images. But there are many tools out there that make this process easier. There is a particularly crazy one known as mokuro that turns the manga into a HTML page. The text bubbles turn into text you can actually use Yomichan on, just like a normal web page! \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 has some non-standard ways of writing words that make it tricky to use a dictionary with. Such as \u305d\u3046 being written as \u305d\u30fc This \"\u30fc\" is not the kanji \u4e00 (one). It is actually a vowel elongation mark. It is known as \"\u9577\u97f3\" (\u3061\u3087\u3046\u304a\u3093). The kanji of this mean long, sound!. \u3068\u30fc would be \u3068\u3046. \u3073\u30fc would be \u3073\u3044. etc. I have made a Yotsubato reading helper to help you with words like these. Everything you need is in this .zip file: (Download) Note: A typo I made in the reading helper: \u304a\u3044\u3066\u304f\u305e is actually \u304a\u3044\u3066\u3044\u304f\u305e, not \u304a\u3044\u3066\u304a\u304f\u305e Japanese manga is in vertical text. This means the text is read downwards from the rightmost line to the leftmost line. Q: So, what will I need to be doing from today until the 30th day? As always you will need to do your Anki and grammar study. Your immersion will get more... complicated. You will need to balance reading that manga and your usual immersion. Shoving everything into the same day may be too difficult. I suggest replacing your reading practice with Yotsubato! instead of Japanese subtitles. It doesn't have to be every day if you don't want to. Word looking up trick: The Yomichan Search Page You can use Yomichan to search up words by typing it or copy and pasting it. You will need to use the Yomichan search page to look up words from my Yotsubato Reading Helper. You can access the search page by clicking on the Yomichan icon in your browser extensions toolbar, and then clicking the magnifying glass icon. Or by pressing Alt Ins Q: How long will it actually take to read 100 pages? A: At a pace of 10 minutes per page, it will take 16 hours and 40 minutes. If you read it for 1 hour every day for the rest of the 30 days, you can finish it in time. This is assuming your pace stays at 10 minutes per page though! Your pace can increase the more you get used to reading Yotsubato. Q: Am I looking up every word in the manga or am I using a dice to decide? A: I want you to look up as much as you can. Q: I don't understand the sentences! Don't worry if you don't understand sentences. You don't understand them because they aren't i+1. (Only 1 component of the sentence that you aren't already quite comfortable with) With more reading, more i+1 opportunities arise. And when you read, look up, and understand i+1 sentences, your Japanese comprehension level increases. And with enough reading, you'll be able to go back to those difficult sentences and understand them at least a little better. In other words, you'll only learn to understand sentences with more reading!!! Important! Learning how to read for long hours and making it enjoyable. \u00b6 Timeboxing \u00b6 Pomodoro The Pomodoro timer method is where you focus on a task for a set time (usually 25 minutes) until the timer rings, then you take a break for 5 minutes. When your 5 minutes are up, you go back to focusing. Use this Pomodoro timer: https://pomofocus.io/ You should reduce the time to 15 minutes if 25 minutes is too long. 20-sided dice For anyone that isn't feeling like reading for too long on a particular day, you can roll a 20-sided dice to decide how many minutes you're gonna read. Roll a 20-sided dice Or you could use the 20-sided dice to decide how many minutes reading you're gonna do between anime episodes! Skimming/Skipping \u00b6 Reading isn't about reading all of the text in the book. You need to learn how to skip and skim things that don't interest you/annoy you etc. If that annoying part of the book was any good then it would make you wanna read it right? You can always go back to that one annoying part after you've read the good bits after all. If you want to, of course. Take breaks! \u00b6 Take breaks if you feel tired/fatigued! Day 15 to Day 30: Daily Japanese Study and Immersion \u60aa\u6226\u82e6\u95d8 ! \u00b6 Until the 30th day, all I want you to do is: Anki your grammar study \"Immersion\" = (reading that manga, raw listening anime, subtitle tutor, passive listening, Japanese subtitles) The method is pretty much that. You will be doing the same thing for the next few weeks. Keep up with it. You're doing great! Q: During this period can I read and watch other things that you haven't talked about? Of course! Read what interests you! Watch what interests you! This study guide (UsagiSpoon) was just making a few of the decisions for you. Q: What is the ideal UsagiSpoon lifesyle? A: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Qxr8OGkaA Day 31 and beyond: After UsagiSpoon? \u00b6 At this point, you will have enough of a foundation to proceed with learning on your own. There are a few \"Japanese learning tasks\" I'd like to set you. There is no time limit for these tasks. Some you might not even be able to do until months or years down the line! Nevertheless, I highly recommend you do them. Finish the entirety of Yotsubato volume 1 Finish the Core deck Finish the RRTK450 deck Do the Kanji Phonetics deck. Finish Cure Dolly's grammar guide Study all the Japanese grammar from the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar. There is an Anki deck for that here . There are 629 grammar points ranging from beginner to advanced. Start studying Japanese pronunciation and pitch accent with this guide Start reading longer texts such as visual novels. Participate in TheMoeWay Discord's VN club to hang out with other people doing the same. Train your ability to recognize and read Japanese numbers, with this resource: Practice Japanese Numbers . Start a \"mining\" Anki deck sometime after you finish the Core deck. Finish a visual novel in under 6 months after starting it. Try using a monolingual dictionary after you finish a visual novel.

Surrounding your daily life with Japanese is the most important part of the immersion method. It may be hard to decide, but you'll need to find content that interests you and you'll need to make consuming it a habit. Slice of life is a good place to start. There are many, many anime that have simple Japanese. Here are some suggestions (but you can use anything you want): Love Live! (Any) Non Non Biyori Kimetsu no Yaiba Koe no Katachi Hotarubi no Mori e Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo Himouto! Umaru-chan Nakitai Watashi wa Neko o Kaburu Yuru Yuri Precure (Any) Gabriel Dropout Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight K-on Ao haru Ride Usagi Drop Flying Witch Byousoku 5 Centimeter Kiniro Mosaic New Game See Anime Resources for places to find anime. Downloading the anime is preferred because it makes it easier to bring the anime portably. Q: Everything here is so boooooring!!!! I'd rather watch something actually good! A: And I like your way of thinking! Immersion is all about spending time with content that interests you. So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions. Your task: I want you to try immersing for the first time with the \"subtitle tutor\" method. The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an anime with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier). The flowchart process: Watch with English subtitles Watch without any subtitles (also known as raw listening) Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.) Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input. While watching the episode raw, don't worry if you can't understand. Try to focus on the sounds, the speaking patterns and anything in it that you can make meaning out of. Becoming able to understand Japanese is a skill that takes a long time. But it all begins with raw listening and trying to make that listening comprehensible. The subtitle tutor method is only meant to provide context for the audio you are listening to. I also recommend listening to the audio when doing other things. By doing that you are essentially filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said. Note: Listening while doing other things = passive immersion . Listening with undivided attention = active immersion . Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study? A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of their environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Japanese and get a deeper feel for the language. Q: So, I've completed my first episode, what should I do now? A: You can consider your immersion done for the day but if you want to do more (which is great) then you can roll a dice to decide how many episodes you want to watch. Roll a dice I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.","title":"Stage: Creating your own Japan at home"},{"location":"routine/#day-3","text":"","title":"Day 3"},{"location":"routine/#stage-just-starting-grammar","text":"Do your daily kana practice on this site! https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html for 10 minutes.

Watch 3 videos a day That is a good number, you will be near the end of her guide after 30 days at that pace. Take notes. Q: What should I even put in my notes? A: You should put information that you feel is important. Rely on your instincts. If Cure Dolly says this means that, then you might want to take a note of it. Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone. Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes. Q: Why should I even do notes! I can probably remember everything anyway! A: I want you to take notes so you can go over them whenever you need to. (Keyword: when you need to!) You are essentially making your own little mini version of the videos in your notes. So, if you do forget something, you can always just look at your notes. Q: I really don't want to take notes...

Remember the routine from the previous day: 3 Cure Dolly videos ! After you've done that, let's set up Anki. First, I want you to watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI Now let's download Anki. You can download Anki by visiting the official website ( here ) and clicking on the Download button. It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option. Download the required deck here When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the \"interface language selector\". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine. Go into Tools on the top bar, and click Preferences (Ctrl+P) . In this window, click on the Scheduling tab, and check (\u2713) the option \" V3 Scheduler \". And change the Learn ahead limit to 900 . Now click Close. In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button Import File is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck. Once clicked, it should open the file picker window. Choose your downloaded deck. When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok. Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it. The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day. 20 cards is the default. 20 cards may or not be manageable. You might want to lower the number of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now. Click the cog icon next to the Core2.3k Version 3 deck. Click Options . Change Maximum reviews/day to 9999 . This just means \"uncapped\". The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki every day but, It is good practice to uncap your review limit. Just some Anki know-how. You also need to change the Learning steps to 1m 5m 10m . Change Insertion order , to Sequential (oldest cards first) Under the Lapses section, change the Relearning Steps to 10m . Under the Display Order section, change the New/review order to Show before reviews . Now click Save . I also want you to install the Speed Focus Mode Anki add-on. I will explain why later, but let's just install it now. Click on Tools at the top of Anki, and click Add-ons . Click Get Add-ons... . Paste this code into the box: 1046608507 and click OK . You need to restart Anki. Close Anki, and launch it back up. Click the cog icon next to the Core2.3k Version 3 deck. Hold the Shift key and click Options . A different looking menu with some red text should open. (If it did not, you did it wrong. You need to hold Shift while clicking Options ). In the General tab, there are a few settings you need to change. Change Automatically play alert to 10 seconds. Change Automatically show answer to 15 seconds. Change Automatically rate 'again' to 60 seconds. Now let's get to studying the deck. When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking Study now First thing you'll notice.... There's a word you can probably read... \"\u3059\u308b\"... (IF THE WORD IS NOT \u3059\u308b THEN YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR CARD INSERTION ORDER!) But there is also line below it with absolutely CRAZY kanji.... Ignore that! Only focus on the top line. That's what you actually need to learn. The line below it is just an example sentence. I can't say it's very useful at this point. But everything in this deck is insanely common. Now I want you to read this carefully, What you are actually being tested for is, whether or not you can read the word and ALSO know what it means. In Japanese learning we call this \"learning the reading and meaning \" For a word like, \u3059\u308b, the reading is easy. It's just \u3059\u308b! It isn't in kanji. The next word \u8a00\u3046, does use kanji though. When you click Show answer at the bottom (shortcut: Space ), you can see what the word means. This deck also other interesting features. A picture at the back. Audio at the back. The picture illustrates the example sentence. It is not important. There is also a sentence translation at the bottom. Scroll down if you can't see it. Wait a second. You might have been wondering. Why can't I even see the word in the example sentence it is supposed to be in? The reason is, it is actually there, it is just inflected. Inflections are something you will learn from Cure Dolly. These inflections are absolutely CRAZY for you right now, so do not worry about learning inflections from this deck. The example sentences are too advanced for you. When you learn a word in Japanese, you learn its \"base\" form. This means its un-inflected form. Wait a second. So, what do you actually do from here? Well, you see that white line at the top going through the card? That is the separator between the \"front\" and the \"back\" of the card. The first line on the back of the card is the Reading . The second line on the back of the card is the Meaning . Those are the 2 pieces of information that you must remember. Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else. Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself. Think of Again as \"I FAILED\". Easy as SUPER EASY, Good as normal/usual/eh, and Hard as \"I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right\". Because this is a card that is seen for the first time , press \"Again\". When seeing \"unseen cards\" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing Again . This will send the card to the \"Learning\" pile. You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1? The red number is the learning pile. Blue: New pile Red: Learning pile Green: Review pile The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. Getting a \"Good\" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in x number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards). When the learning pile (red number) goes down that means the card has graduated. Do not spend a long time looking at the same card When you don't know the word even after 15 seconds of looking at it, then looking at it for even longer doesn't mean you'll suddenly remember it. So, the purpose of the Speed Focus Mode add-on is to stop you from spending too much time on one card. My card learning method Step 1: Look at the card. Step 2: Recognize whether it is a new card or not. Step 3: Reveal the back (Show answer) after realizing it is a new card. Step 4: Read the reading. Step 5: Read the meaning. Step 6: Let the audio play. Step 7: For now, press \"Again\" Step 8: Above 7 steps will be the same if the next card is also a new card but... Step 9: If the next card is one I've already seen before, I test my knowledge. Step 10: I try to recall the word's meaning and the reading. Step 11: There are sometimes more than 1 meaning. Only 1 meaning is enough. Step 12: I reveal the back. Step 13: I grade myself depending on if the meaning and reading I thought it was, was correct. Step 14: I usually use the Good button if I got it correct. Again if it wasn't correct. After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day. The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards! Please make sure you do Anki every day! Q: Why does UsagiSpoon recommend Core instead of Tango? A: Short answer: You learn more with Core. Core teaches a new word with each card. The order of words is optimized for anime and visual novels because it teaches the most common words from them. Tango on the other hand, has tons of cards that do not introduce new words, and repeats a lot of similar sentences. \u2190 IMO this is just inefficient. Tango also has weird English translations and stuff. While I was writing this day of UsagiSpoon I originally wrote the entire thing showing you how to use the Tango deck. But I had to point out \"Hey don't look at the translations!\", and \"There are a lot of words you will probably never see in anime...\" etc, etc. So in the end I saw how the Core deck was better and decided to use that. While Core is significantly more difficult (obviously! It is actually introducing something new with every single card) but it will benefit you more than using Tango. Q: Should I worry if I forget a lot? A: No. Anki is made for things you're likely to forget. You are very likely to forget words of a language you just started learning. I don't think it is strange if you forget more than half of what you learn when a day passes by. You're likely to forget these words without Anki, so that's why you need to keep Anki'ing them so you can finally learn the word. In other words, just keep doing Anki. If this continues for a while then you might want to think back on your method of doing Anki. Q: Leeches (Words not sticking) Leeches are when you keep forgetting the word no matter what. Memory works by picking up on cues. When words don't stick, it means there are multiple things in the wider scope of the word that makes it so your mind isn't picking on any cues. In easier terms, you need more, or different information than the information on the card. For these leeches, I recommend looking at them in example sentences. You can use Jisho.org with the #sentence tag to see example sentences with an English translation. Setting up a Japanese Keyboard Now let's set up a Japanese keyboard. Read this article: http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/ The article is very good. After you've done that lemme teach you the most useful functions. Alt ` (backquote)(the key left of 1): Switch from entering just letters like these to kana like this: \u304b\u306a. if you type \"kana\" when the symbol on the taskbar is an \"A\" it will just be \"kana\" but if the symbol is \u3042 then it will become \"\u304b\u306a\" Space : Conversion. When you want to type a kanji, you have to type its reading, and then use space to convert it. Due to Japanese's... japanesesiness, there are multiple conversion candidates for the kana you entered. Let's try a word you probably just learned, like \u8a00\u3046. To type that in kanji you have to switch to kana input mode (the \u3042 symbol) and type \u3044\u3046, then press space until \u8a00\u3046 is selected, and then press Enter . If you want to enter kana without converting, just type what you want and press enter. F7 : Katakana conversion. Win Space : Switch input methods (only effective if you have more than one input method (example English (UK) and Japanese (Japan) ) Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion. I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing. I recommend you decide on a set number of anime episodes to use for immersion per day.

It is going to be quite tough. But don't worry if you don't understand it! Every bit counts! First, practice kana for 10 minutes. Kana Practice Site 10 Minute Timer After that, go on to doing your Anki. After your Anki, do your 3 Cure Dolly videos. Then let's get on to reading. Your first reading content will be anime with Japanese subtitles. It is kind of tricky to set it up, but let's go through it. First, you will need Yomichan. Click on this link to read my guide on it. After you have set up Yomichan, follow the rest of these steps. In your Chrome extension settings ( chrome://extensions ), enable \" Developer mode \" in the top right . Now download the asbplayer Extension It has to be installed manually; it is not on the Chrome Web Store. You need to unzip the .zip file first. Now you go in your Chrome extension settings and click \"Load unzipped\" Choose the unzipped folder. Restart your browser. Now you need to get subtitle files for the anime you want to watch. Let's just use... Love Live (2013) as an example. The site Kitsunekko has the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime. (NOTE: The site has a tendency of going down randomly. You can view a backup here ) I scrolled down to \"Love Live!\", and downloaded the \"Love Live! (01-13) (Webrip).zip\" file. After unzipping the file, I got a bunch of .SRT files. .SRT files are subtitle files. Now what you need to do is drag and drop an .SRT file onto a video. The asbplayer extension works with Aniwatch . I recommend streaming from there. Before you start playing an episode, make sure you have this page open: https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ When an episode starts playing, you can drag and drop an .SRT file onto it. The subtitles should load and work. English subtitles display at the same time, which is bad for learning because English subs can confuse you when you try to understand the actual Japanese structure behind the meaning. For just giving context to the audio, they are fine though. Anyway, to disable English subtitles, click the CC icon on the video player controls and click Off. By using Shift on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. But there is a problem. The subtitle file for Love Live is horribly out of sync ! This means the subtitles don't match the timing of the audio. Luckily, asbplayer supports adjusting the timing. You can do that with Ctrl Shift Left or Right . Sometimes it doesn't work if you don't click on the video first. You will need to experiment to find the right timing. For Love Live it was -8400ms. It might be hard to figure out what subtitle belongs to what audio when reading is so difficult. Sentences written in kana make it easier to tell which is which though. This page https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/ displays the subtitles in a list. This makes it easier to go back to a line you missed. It only works if you had it open before loading the subtitle. This also enables you to \"read\" the anime! Which I recommend you do!!! So, what's the routine? Watch the anime with Japanese subtitles first. Then focus your attention on just reading it. Q: How many words do I look up? A: I think you should decide this using a 20-sided dice, per episode. Click here for 20-sided dice Roll! After you've looked up your amount just watch the rest with Japanese subs. If anything piques your interest, then feel free to look it up! Q: When watching with Japanese subs, do I try to read everything on the screen? A: No. I generally recommend looking up the number of words the dice decided and then just watch the rest of the episode without looking anything up or stopping to read anything, but you should focus on how the kana are pronounced etc. Q: When I look up something, or need to read something, do I pause the video? A: Yes! Pause the video when you need to look up! Q: What is the point of the subtitles in a list? A: You do it so you can do \"raw reading practice\". When the anime playing, you are doing half-reading half-listening. When you remove the audio part and just read the subtitles in a list, you are doing the equivalent of real reading! Q: Does the dice decide how many words I look up while watching the anime or while reading the subtitles in a list? A: Roll another 20 sided dice for when you read the anime. Q: How many episodes should I read? Focus on reading a single anime episode until you've looked up the amount of dice decided words. Q: Is it possible to understand everything by spending 30 minutes spamming Yomichan on a sentence? A: Short answer: No. Comprehension is a gradual process. Long answer: There are many things you will not understand just by using a dictionary. There are many factors that go into understanding something. There are obvious factors such as vocabulary and grammar. But there are also less obvious ones such as the contexts that that piece of language is often used in, which in turns leads to its meaning. In a vacuum, studying vocabulary and grammar increases your ability to understand things. But understanding the use of the vocabulary and grammar in contexts further increases your understanding of the sentence. This works especially well for sentences that have only one piece of language that you aren't comfortable with. This doesn't work well for hard sentences though. Because there is too much language information in the sentence that you are too unfamiliar with. The best you can do for hard sentences is to look up the vocabulary in them. While it may not be enough to understand that sentence at that time, your newly found knowledge of the word can help you connect it to some meaning in a later context. With more study and immersion (understanding things in context), your understanding of Japanese will increase. Q: Do I have to change the anime I'm reading to the one I last watched? No. I actually recommend reading the same one until you read the end. But you don't have to always use the same one if it no longer interests you. Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up? A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember. In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now. Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time. What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like \"Oh, right!\". And move on. Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Japanese has no spaces! A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner. You get better at it over time. Language learning is just pattern recognition after all. Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy. Q: Now that I can see the Japanese, can I try to translate it in my head? A: It's complicated... There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Japanese. The way of thinking is a lot different. That is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tends to advise against trying to translate your immersion. Because Japanese is not English. You are advised to think of Japanese as Japanese. Be the language! You can do some sort of \"loose translation\", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning. Do I need to translate at all? Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (Missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning that's hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.) It is also tiring, so do it in moderation. Q: How many episodes should I watch with Japanese subs until I go back to no subs? A: 1 Japanese subtitled episode per day is a good number. 2 or 3 if you want to go all out. Q: Should I watch Japanese subs or raw? A: They exist for different purposes. I can't say which one is better because they have their own benefits and drawbacks. Japanese subs: Good: learn new words, reading practice Bad: doesn't train raw listening ability, you might not pick up on things said in the audio Raw: Good: trains raw listening ability and can attribute to speaking ability too. You will notice more than just watching with Japanese subtitles. Bad: the words you dont know you just don't know. Q: What about subtitle tutor? A: You shouldn't be doing it all the time. The only purpose is to give you an idea; context of what the audio is saying. It gets tedious watching the same episode twice too. Without watching the episode in Japanese after you watch it in English, there is no point. And using English subs as a crutch forever isn't a good idea. It just makes your immersion more effective in the beginning because immersion works better when you have an idea of what is going on . Getting rid of translations and training yourself to understand the language on its own is how you'll get better at Japanese in the future. Japanese subs are better because they give you the opportunity to learn the actual words that are being used in the anime.

I know it has been tough (especially Anki and reading!), but the beginner stage is always the hardest part of learning any language, and things will only get easier the longer you do it. With more time spent doing the right methods, you'll certainly improve. You may have your doubts on what this method is actually doing, so allow me to explain. Your Anki ,\u3000 grammar study and looking up words is where you are increasing your knowledge of the language. Your listening and reading practice are where you are applying your knowledge , by getting exposure to how these parts of the language are used by natives. The subtitle tutor method aims to boost the comprehensibility of your listening immersion by giving you context of what is being said in the audio. Your Japanese subtitle listening helps you: associate kana with sounds, figure out what words are being said and ease you into reading. Your raw (no subs) listening practice is where you build a mental model of how the language actually sounds. This is good for a number of reasons. The main reasons being getting a good accent, and also being able to hear the words that you know. Listening isn't as clear as reading, it can be very fast and hard to keep up with. By getting used to raw listening you can train yourself to hear these unclear things better. When you get advanced at Japanese and understand your raw listening immersion, mass raw listening is the only way to get fluent. Your passive listening fills in the gaps where you otherwise wouldn't be doing Japanese.","title":"Day 14"},{"location":"routine/#stage-100-page-yotsubato-challenge","text":"From today until the 30th day. I want you to challenge yourself to read 100 pages of the \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 manga. \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 is a great slice of life manga that features furigana (kana on the top of kanji). Manga are tricky to look up words on because they are essentially, text on images. But there are many tools out there that make this process easier. There is a particularly crazy one known as mokuro that turns the manga into a HTML page. The text bubbles turn into text you can actually use Yomichan on, just like a normal web page! \u3088\u3064\u3070\u3068\uff01 has some non-standard ways of writing words that make it tricky to use a dictionary with. Such as \u305d\u3046 being written as \u305d\u30fc This \"\u30fc\" is not the kanji \u4e00 (one). It is actually a vowel elongation mark. It is known as \"\u9577\u97f3\" (\u3061\u3087\u3046\u304a\u3093). The kanji of this mean long, sound!. \u3068\u30fc would be \u3068\u3046. \u3073\u30fc would be \u3073\u3044. etc. I have made a Yotsubato reading helper to help you with words like these. Everything you need is in this .zip file: (Download) Note: A typo I made in the reading helper: \u304a\u3044\u3066\u304f\u305e is actually \u304a\u3044\u3066\u3044\u304f\u305e, not \u304a\u3044\u3066\u304a\u304f\u305e Japanese manga is in vertical text. This means the text is read downwards from the rightmost line to the leftmost line. Q: So, what will I need to be doing from today until the 30th day? As always you will need to do your Anki and grammar study. Your immersion will get more... complicated. You will need to balance reading that manga and your usual immersion. Shoving everything into the same day may be too difficult. I suggest replacing your reading practice with Yotsubato! instead of Japanese subtitles. It doesn't have to be every day if you don't want to. Word looking up trick: The Yomichan Search Page You can use Yomichan to search up words by typing it or copy and pasting it. You will need to use the Yomichan search page to look up words from my Yotsubato Reading Helper. You can access the search page by clicking on the Yomichan icon in your browser extensions toolbar, and then clicking the magnifying glass icon. Or by pressing Alt Ins Q: How long will it actually take to read 100 pages? A: At a pace of 10 minutes per page, it will take 16 hours and 40 minutes. If you read it for 1 hour every day for the rest of the 30 days, you can finish it in time. This is assuming your pace stays at 10 minutes per page though! Your pace can increase the more you get used to reading Yotsubato. Q: Am I looking up every word in the manga or am I using a dice to decide? A: I want you to look up as much as you can. Q: I don't understand the sentences! Don't worry if you don't understand sentences. You don't understand them because they aren't i+1. (Only 1 component of the sentence that you aren't already quite comfortable with) With more reading, more i+1 opportunities arise. And when you read, look up, and understand i+1 sentences, your Japanese comprehension level increases. And with enough reading, you'll be able to go back to those difficult sentences and understand them at least a little better. In other words, you'll only learn to understand sentences with more reading!!!","title":"Stage: 100-page Yotsubato! challenge"},{"location":"routine/#important-learning-how-to-read-for-long-hours-and-making-it-enjoyable","text":"","title":"Important!

Output is just the icing on the cake. When it comes to learning a foreign language, we usually think, \u201cOh if I speak it a lot, I will get good!\u201d. Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Japanese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Japanese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!) . But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice. You need to input so that you already know what\u2019s correct before speaking, because you have heard it in your input, so you will know exactly what natural thing to say before you have a conversation. With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Japanese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized. When this happens it is clear you need more input. In other words if you can't think of how to express your thoughts, you need more input. After you feel confident again, you can go back to outputting. Another reason why it is bad to output early is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and a native speaker won\u2019t inform you. So you could be making big mistakes but not realising. Maybe you don't like making mistakes. But here\u2019s why it may not be a good idea talking to natives. \u00b6 If you expect to be corrected, then you're out of luck. Natives will not correct you. It is impolite to correct someone\u2019s speech, as they could take offense to it. It is not an exclusively Japanese thing. I tend to notice unnatural phrasing in non-English natives but I do not correct them, as I could come off as a \u201cgrammar n#zi\u201d. I\u2019m sure Japanese people would feel the same about correcting your Japanese too. Most native speakers on HelloTalk and similar apps don\u2019t want to practice Japanese. They want to practice English with you. So they are stalling any chance of you ever practicing. When you do not have a decent grasp of the Japanese spoken language (e.g. understand most anime) and try to speak, it will be mistake-ridden and extremely frustrating to speak. It will be much more motivating to just immerse. Even if you ask them to correct you, they will not. Here\u2019s why it may be a good idea talking to natives \u00b6 It is fun. There is no denying outputting is fun when you are able to do it correctly. In my case when I output naturally and my Japanese friends understand exactly what I want to say, that\u2019s a motivation boost for me. And hey, if you want to speak, then do it! There is no one stopping you. It's better than speaking to learners, for sure. What if I make a mistake? \u00b6 Get over it and move on. It\u2019s not a big deal. As long as you are immersing everyday it is no big deal! Can I talk to other learners? Speaking Japanese to other Japanese learners is the WORST thing you could ever do. Because as a learner you can't tell if someone's Japanese is natural or not, so you could learn something incorrect. This can be fixed by talking with natives instead. Other Links \u00b6 AntiMoon Article Main Guide Have fun immersing! Extra Note: Reading overload \u00b6 I spoke quite a lot about how you shouldn't read until you got a lot of listening immersion. This is because it is to ensure you get a good accent in the end. The reason why you should listen to Japanese first is to build a model of how Japanese sounds in your head, to get you used to how Japanese sounds, for example how Japanese \"ra ri ru re ro\" sounds are much different than the English sounds. If you read without this knowledge, you may end up speaking with a foreign accent. Foreign accents happen when you think a sound in the target language is the same as a similar sounding sound in your native because you haven't listened long enough. It is almost impossible to read a language without applying any phonetic component to it, so even if you read in your head, you may still get this problem. Of course, if you don't care about accent, and would be fine with a gaijin accent, then you don't really need to listen. If you don't listen at all but just learn how to read that's fine if you still want to watch anime with subtitles, and just want to play VNs or whatever. Methods of approaching Japanese are never one-size-fits-all. But, I think it will really hurt your ego if you can read chuuni visual novels but can't understand anime, and you may not be motivated to start mass listening late because it's like, \"Why would I listen, I don't understand it. I can play so much cool VNs in Japanese so I'd rather just do that\". That's why I encourage listening right from the beginning. I hope you understand.","title":"Speaking Japanese"},{"location":"speaking/#speaking-japanese","text":"Input is the core of getting good at speaking a foreign language. Output is just the icing on the cake. When it comes to learning a foreign language, we usually think, \u201cOh if I speak it a lot, I will get good!\u201d. Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Japanese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Japanese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!) . But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice. You need to input so that you already know what\u2019s correct before speaking, because you have heard it in your input, so you will know exactly what natural thing to say before you have a conversation. With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Japanese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized. When this happens it is clear you need more input. In other words if you can't think of how to express your thoughts, you need more input. After you feel confident again, you can go back to outputting. Another reason why it is bad to output early is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and a native speaker won\u2019t inform you. So you could be making big mistakes but not realising. Maybe you don't like making mistakes.","title":"Speaking Japanese"},{"location":"speaking/#but-heres-why-it-may-not-be-a-good-idea-talking-to-natives","text":"If you expect to be corrected, then you're out of luck. Natives will not correct you. It is impolite to correct someone\u2019s speech, as they could take offense to it. It is not an exclusively Japanese thing.

I\u2019m sure Japanese people would feel the same about correcting your Japanese too. Most native speakers on HelloTalk and similar apps don\u2019t want to practice Japanese. They want to practice English with you. So they are stalling any chance of you ever practicing. When you do not have a decent grasp of the Japanese spoken language (e.g. understand most anime) and try to speak, it will be mistake-ridden and extremely frustrating to speak. It will be much more motivating to just immerse.

Follow the steps below to run VNs on FreeBSD. Japanese and UTF-8 support \u00b6 By default, FreeBSD is unable to display Japanese text. Installing a Japanese font \u00b6 Make sure you have a Japanese font before proceeding. I recommend the following fonts: ja-font-ipa ja-font-koruri ja-font-sazanami ja-font-kochi ja-font-mplus-ipa ja-font-vlgothic hanazono-fonts-ttf You can install them from binary package by doing: sudo pkg install ja-font-ipa ja-font-koruri ja-font-sazanami ja-font-kochi ja-font-mplus-ipa ja-font-vlgothic hanazono-fonts-ttf You can verify that your FreeBSD system is able to display Japanese text if you can see the Japanese text below: \u3066\u3059\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u8a66\u9a13 Enabling Unicode UTF-8 \u00b6 FreeBSD also does not use Unicode by default. So Japanese filenames will be broken. You need to add these lines to your /etc/login.conf 25 26 27 28 default:\\ [...] :charset=UTF-8:\\ :lang=en_US.UTF-8: Now rebuild database for this file: sudo cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf Log out by using pkill -u $USER and log back in. KDE5/SDDM If you are using KDE, create a file called locale.sh in $HOME/.config/plasma-workspace/env/ . If the directory doesn't exist then just make it. Add the following contents: 1 2 export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export MM_CHARSET=UTF-8 Graphics Drivers \u00b6 This is important as we will need hardware acceleration. If you haven't already installed graphics drivers on your FreeBSD system, please do that now. [AMD/ATI Radeon and Intel Graphics] [NVIDIA Graphics] Installing Wine and dependencies \u00b6 Tip If you are having issues with the binary packages, try compiling from the ports. Wine on FreeBSD has limited functionality compared to its Linux counterpart. For example, you are not able to use WOW64 (64 bit Windows but able to run 32-bit applications) and you also must use the i386-wine package of Wine if on an amd64 system. Do not be fooled by this name, if you are on a 32-bit system, use the regular wine package. However. lack of WOW64 support is not an issue for visual novels, as they are all 32-bit anyway. First install all the needed dependencies for Wine first, this is to ensure you don't end up in \"Wine dependency hell\": lib32 You need to have lib32 for this to work! Check if /usr/lib32 exists! If you did not get it when installing FreeBSD, get it now. Get lib32.txz for your FreeBSD version [here] Then run sudo tar -C / -xpf lib32.txz and then run sudo freebsd-update sudo pkg install p7zip cabextract freetype libosmesa libpcap libjpeg-turbo sane-backends ncurses ocl-icd liberation-fonts-ttf libgphoto2 json-c unixODBC nss_mdns gstreamer1 gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-ugly gstreamer-plugins-bad alsa-plugins libx11 libXcursor libXi libXext libXxf86vm libXrandr libXinerama libGLU libXrender libzip lcms2 cups libxml2 libxslt flac libICE libSM libXtst libXcomposite openal-soft gtk3 libva libexif mpg123 Now, we need to install Wine: sudo pkg install i386-wine-devel We will now need winetricks , do not use the one on the FreeBSD repository as it is outdated and WILL cause headaches. Using, curl , download the latest winetricks binary. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks --output winetricks Using chmod , make it executable. chmod +x winetricks Now copy it to your /usr/local/bin so it can be used in a command line. sudo cp winetricks /usr/local/bin Configuring Wine and installing runtimes \u00b6 Creating the Wineprefix \u00b6 First we need to create a 32 bit Wine prefix, this has the best compatibility and all visual novels are 32-bit anyway. WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn WINEARCH = win32 wineboot When Wine is started for the first time, you will need to let it install Gecko and Mono packages. Using Winetricks \u00b6 Now we need to install the common redistributables such as DirectX, Visual C++ Runtimes and .NET Framework 3.5 and other things that make video cutscenes work. Optional: Font smoothing You can do winetricks fontsmooth=rgb because without it, the font is simply awful. Optional: GUI Improvments You can open the Registry Editor using wine regedit and import this .reg file , the GUI should look nice and clean then. First, please update Winetricks, or else it will not work. sudo winetricks --self-update Now we can use Winetricks: WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks ffdshow quartz wmp10 d3dx9 dotnet35 vcrun2003 vcrun2005 vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 ffdshow When installing ffdshow, make sure you check (tick) \u2611 every single codec/format or else it will not work! For some VNs, such as TYPE-MOON's, LAVFilters may be needed to playback video. WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks lavfilters ffdshow and LAVFilters Some games may break if you have both ffdshow and LAVFilters installed! Make sure you experiment! Then, run this command to disable DLL overrides, and use the native DLLs instead: WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks alldlls = default Japanese fonts in Wine \u00b6 You need to install Japanese fonts to Wine now. Please download the pack below. [Google Drive] Unzip the file and move the font files to your Fonts folder in ~/.winevn/drive_c/windows/Fonts Why not install cjkfonts in winetricks? Because it doesn't work properly for VNs. Installing the visual novel \u00b6 FreeBSD does not have CDEmu, FUSEISO or anything similar, so you'll need to mount the disc image file regularly. Luckily, FreeBSD doesn't make the distinction between virtual drives and physical drives. BUT... FreeBSD does not support the simple mounting of drives without using mdconfig and EXECUTING AS ROOT! Even accessing a mounted disc image requires you to have root privileges. You cannot execute Wine as root so we will not be mounting image files. So we will be using 7zip. Extracting the ISO \u00b6 MDS/MDF If you have Alcohol 120% CD/DVD Images (MDS/MDF), you need to use tools such as mdf2iso . Common syntax is mdf2iso <source>.MDF <output>.ISO In other cases you may be able to rename the .MDF file to use the .ISO extension and it will just work. Let's first make our destination folder and cd into it. mkdir ~/extracted cd ~/extracted Now, extract it with 7z : 7z -x /path/to/<disc_image>.ISO Running the installer \u00b6 Now we can finally launch the installer with Wine. LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn wine <setup_executable>.exe .msi installer If the installer executable is an .msi, run with msiexec instead of wine . Proceed with the installation. You may want to take note of the installation directory. C:\\ is relative to $WINEPREFIX/drive_c . Launching the visual novel \u00b6 I used Kanon Memorial Edition for this guide. I can cd into $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/KEY/KANON_ME_ALL and then run REALLIVE.EXE with Wine to launch the VN at any time. cd /path/to/visualnovelfolder LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn wine <vn_executable.exe> AlphaROMdiE For AlphaROMdiE, you need to run it with Wine and the VN executable as an argument. It should look like this: LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn wine AlphaROMdiE.exe <VN_executable.exe> For the 1st option, you must create an empty file disable_conv in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe, for the 3rd option, you must create an empty file other_engine in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe. You can do this easily by doing: touch disable_conv other_engine And viola! Here's a demonstration of 2 VNs working at the same time: And the actual games work see: Now go back to Visual Novel Guide to learn how to use Textractor, it works perfectly under Wine. Please note that it needs to be launched with LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8 environment variable. Need shortcuts? You can add shortcuts to your ${HOME}/Desktop . Create a file such as \"[vn].desktop\".

This works exceptionally well in most cases. Follow the steps below. Linux dependencies The Linux dependency section has been updated for most distros, but the openSUSE and Gentoo parts have been left untouched. When following another distro's instructions, make sure you install ffmpeg and the listed gstreamer plugins. Install Wine & dependencies \u00b6 Arch You will need to enable [multilib] and [community] before running this command.

Optionally, for some VNs, you might want CDEmu which tricks VNs into thinking that the original disc is inserted so it'll let you play the game. sudo pacman -S cdemu-client cdemu-daemon In order to use CDEmu, you need to install the VHBA module. sudo pacman -S vhba-module Custom and LTS Kernels If you are using a custom or LTS kernel, install vhba-module-dkms . Otherwise, install vhba-module . The CDEmu service is loaded with the kernel module. If drivers for CD/DVD drives are not automatically loaded, you can load it manually. sudo modprobe -a sg sr_mod vhba Ubuntu First you will need to enable 32-bit architecture. sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 Download and add the WineHQ repository key: sudo mkdir -pm755 /etc/apt/keyrings sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/winehq-archive.key https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key Add the repository (Ubuntu 22.10): sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/kinetic/winehq-kinetic.sources Other Ubuntu Versions If you use a different version of Ubuntu or a derivative like Linux Mint you must do this instead.

Optionally, for some VNs, you might want CDEmu which tricks VNs into thinking that the original disc is inserted so it'll let you play the game. Enable the rok/cdemu COPR repository: sudo dnf copr enable rok/cdemu Make sure the kernel development package is installed. sudo dnf install kernel-devel If it wasn't already installed or you just updated your system and that included a kernel update, reboot your system before continuing and installing CDEmu.

It is recommended to have the following global use flags in your make.conf : X pulseaudio jpeg png Refer to the gentoo wiki for more information on different verions of wine available on gentoo here . wine-vanilla should be able to run almost everything fine . Be sure that the flag abi_x86_32 is not turned off FOR wine-vanilla (it's on by default), more info visit the wiki here . Install the deps. sudo emerge -v app-emulation/wine-vanilla virtual/wine games-util/lutris app-cdr/cdemu app-emulation/winetricks Load the vhba module for cdemu sudo modprobe vhba To autoload the module on startup, edit your /etc/conf.d/modules file and add this line: modules = \"vhba\" In order for the CDEmu daemon to be started automatically by the UI, you will need to have dbus enabled. You can enable it by running: sudo rc-update add dbus default ## or if systemd the default init sudo systemctl enable dbus Void Enable the multilib and nonfree repositories if you haven't already. sudo xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree void-repo-multilib void-repo-multilib-nonfree Next, install the necessary Linux dependencies. sudo xbps-install -S wine wine-32bit winetricks ffmpeg libavcodec-32bit libavfilter-32bit libavformat-32bit libavresample-32bit libavutil-32bit libpostproc-32bit libswresample-32bit libswscale-32bit alsa-lib alsa-lib-32bit alsa-plugins alsa-plugins-32bit alsa-plugins-ffmpeg alsa-plugins-ffmpeg-32bit gst-plugins-base1 gst-plugins-base1-32bit gst-plugins-good1 gst-plugins-good1-32bit gst-plugins-bad1 gst-plugins-bad1-32bit gst-plugins-ugly1 gst-plugins-ugly1-32bit gst-libav gst-libav-32bit Vulkan-Headers Vulkan-ValidationLayers Vulkan-ValidationLayers-32bit vulkan-loader vulkan-loader-32bit lutris If you need something to mount disc images, run sudo xbps-install -S cdemu-client . When you need to use it, launch cdemu-daemon in a terminal before using the commands listed later in the guide. Configure Wine and install runtimes \u00b6 Creating the Wineprefix \u00b6 First off, create a clean 32-bit Wine prefix. While a 64-bit prefix generally runs 32-bit programs well enough, you can run into unexpected problems (e.g. SafeDisc-protected games only work under 32-bit). WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn WINEARCH = win32 wineboot Using winetricks \u00b6 Now we need to install the common redistributables such as DirectX, Visual C++ Runtimes and .NET Framework 3.5 and other things that make video cutscenes work. Optional: Font smoothing You can do WINEPREFIX=~/.winevn winetricks fontsmooth=rgb because without it, the font is simply awful. Optional: Filetype associations Execute WINEPREFIX=~/.winevn winetricks mimeassoc=off to prevent Wine from taking over as the default application for some file formats. Optional: GUI Improvements You can open the Registry Editor using WINEPREFIX=~/.winevn wine regedit and import this .reg file , the GUI should look nice and clean then. First you need to get the latest patches for Winetricks or else this will not work. sudo winetricks --self-update Now you can use Winetricks. Vulkan Unsupported Systems Most GPUs made in the last decade should support Vulkan . If you have a system that does not support it, remove dxvk from the end of the following command. If you already installed it to the Wine prefix you can remove it by following the instructions here . WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks -q dotnet35 vcrun2003 vcrun2005 vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 lavfilters alldlls = default quartz dxvk You'll be installing Windows Media Player 10 next. As it's not easy to uninstall, you should make a copy of your prefix in its current state somewhere. After that, run the following command. WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks -q wmp10 As the last step, set the renderer to GDI to get around issues with cinematics. WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn winetricks renderer = gdi Renderer The GDI option exists mostly for legacy purposes. While the other renderers are more efficient, Wine tends to crash or skip videos without alerting you when using them. As such, the guide opts for using GDI as the baseline. If you experience any problems like low performance or black screens try running winetricks renderer=gl and only falling back to GDI if you can't progress otherwise. Japanese fonts in Wine \u00b6 You need to install Japanese fonts to Wine now. Please download the pack below. [Google Drive] Unzip the file and move the font files to your Fonts folder in ~/.winevn/drive_c/windows/Fonts . Why not install cjkfonts in winetricks? Because it doesn't work properly for VNs. Lutris initial setup \u00b6 Environment Variables \u00b6 Once that's done, we can set up Lutris. Open Lutris, and click the plus icon in the top left corner, and click Install runners. Scroll down to the bottom and find \"Wine\" and click the cog icon next to it. Now go to System options and set the environment variables as shown below and click Save. Key: LC_ALL Value: ja_JP.UTF-8 Key: TZ Value: Asia/Tokyo Vulkan Unsupported Systems If your system does not support Vulkan, you must disable DXVK in \"Runner options\", this will fallback to regular D3DX9. DXVK is a Vulkan implementation of Direct3D so we will be keeping it on even though Vulkan may not make much of a difference. Installing the visual novel \u00b6 I will be using \u53e4\u8272\u8ff7\u5bae\u8f2a\u821e\u66f2\uff5eHISTOIRE DE DESTIN\uff5e for this demonstration. Visual Novels usually come in .ISO files and if not, an .MDS/.MDF file which can be mounted with cdemu . Mounting disc images \u00b6 Navigate to the path of the disc image: cd /path/to/visualnovelfolder MDS Load the .MDS file with CDEmu first. The Linux mount command will not mount it. cdemu load 0 /path/to/mds_image.MDS UDF Volumes Load the UDF volume with CDEmu. The Linux mount command with the -t udf argument is not advised. cdemu load 0 /path/to/udf_volume CDEmu Mount Point? It should usually be in /run/media/user/image_name If using a regular ISO9660 ISO file create a mount point for it. sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom0 Now we can mount our ISO to our mount point. sudo mount -o loop file.ISO /media/cdrom0 If all went well, you will be able to see the contents of the image by doing ls /media/cdrom0 or whatever your mount point is: Running the installer \u00b6 Localegen Generate the ja_JP.UTF-8 locale first. Next, we will run the setup file using wine : LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn wine <setup_executable>.exe .msi installer If the installer executable is an .msi, run with msiexec instead of wine . Proceed with the installation. The game may be installed in ~/.winevn/drive_c/Program Files or wherever you chose to install it. Adding to Lutris \u00b6 Now we can add the game to Lutris so we can launch it quickly. Back in Lutris, click the plus icon in the corner, add the name of the VN, choose Wine as the runner and under \"Game Options\" navigate to the game's executable. You should also change the prefix architecture to 32-bit. Wine prefix in Lutris Forgot to include this in the picture, but make sure to set the Wine prefix in Lutris too by adding ~/.winevn to the Wine prefix field. AlphaROMdiE For AlphaROMdiE, you need to add AlphaROMdiE to Lutris as the executable, and the filename .exe of the Visual Novel as an argument. If you are using Wine in a command line it should look something like this: LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" WINEPREFIX = ~/.winevn wine AlphaROMdiE.exe <VN_executable.exe> For the 1st option, you must create an empty file disable_conv in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe, for the 3rd option, you must create an empty file other_engine in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe. You can do this easily by doing: touch disable_conv other_engine Now you can just launch it in Lutris! Error: \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 Load the .ISO image with cdemu . Even though Linux can mount ISO9660 images without CDEmu, Wine programs cannot seem to find the mounted image. cdemu load 0 /path/to/image.ISO and voila! Now go back to Visual Novel Guide to learn how to use Textractor, it works perfectly under Wine. Also consider adding Textractor to Lutris for quick access. Linux: Troubleshooting \u00b6 Glitchy videos \u00b6 If you experience videos breaking in some way like playing upside-down, try running them in the prefix from before installing wmp10. As video support in Wine varies greatly, there's no real silver bullet solution that works for everything. Make sure to experiment - some VNs work fine without Windows Media Player but others won't (e.g. Yuzusoft VNs like Sanoba Witch will skip without it). Though that's less likely, LAVFilters might also play a factor in some cases - if something goes wrong run wine control and try uninstalling it.

You don't usually need to do this. This means your VN needs to use ja_JP.sjis instead of ja_JP.UTF-8. You need to download ja_JP.sjis from here first.

You can buy visual novels on DLsite, DMM or even Steam in some cases. Please note that you need a DVD compatible optical drive if you buy your visual novels on optical disc. If your computer does not have a DVD drive, you will need an another computer that has one to create a rip of the DVD disc to a disc image file or use an external USB DVD drive. Alternatively, you may not buy the VNs, and download them using the links found in Resources . Please note that this is piracy and if you enjoy the VN, consider supporting the creators and buy it. On mobile however, VNs will be distributed as digital download through its respective app store. Glossary: disc image file A disc image file does not refer to a picture of a disc, rather it is a file (usually .iso ) that contains an exact copy of what was on a disc. You can use tools such as WinCDEmu or Alcohol 120% to make an exact copy of what was on the disc onto an .iso or .mdf/.mds file.

If you have a Windows PC, you will always be able to run visual novels as long as your visual novel supports the Windows version you are running. For most VNs out there, Windows 7 is a minimum, older titles will also work on XP. Newer titles released after 2019 will require Windows 8.1 as a minimum. Step 1. Japanese Locale \u00b6 Japanese visual novels will not run without Japanese locale. Some may run, but have limited functionality, audio, visuals and saving may not work. Japanese locale is the minimum requirement for running Japanese games on your Windows PC. You may use a locale emulator, though it is less of a hassle to just change system-wide locale in my opinion. Follow the steps below to set Japanese locale on your Windows system. Setting Japanese locale Open the Run dialog box by pressing Win + R Type intl.cpl and press Enter Click on the Administrative tab, go to Change system locale... and select Japanese (Japan) and click OK. Reboot your PC to apply the changes. FAQ: What about \"Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support\"? Keep it disabled. This is a recent feature of Windows 10. We do not need it for VNs, it is unrelated, and may cause problems. If you're curious: It sets codepage 65001, overriding codepage 932 (Japanese locale), we do not want this. Advanced Users: Powershell Japanese locale can also be enabled using Windows Powershell (Administrator) : Set-WinSystemLocale -SystemLocale ja-JP ; Restart-Computer This will restart your PC. Step 2. Mounting the setup files \u00b6 Non-pirated If you have bought your game on an optical disc, please insert the disc into your DVD drive. A new volume will appear on the Explorer sidebar, click on it and run the setup to proceed. If you bought your game as digital download, it will come in a .zip file, extract it with 7-Zip In some cases there will be no need for installation, in other cases you may need to install the game by running the setup and register with the DRM. Pirated If you have not bought the game, it will likely become archived in a .rar , .7z or .zip format, and within it may be disc image files. Follow the instructions below to extract and mount the setup files. Requirements: Get 7-Zip Get WinCDEmu We will be using 2 pieces of software today, 7-Zip which is a tool for making and extracting archives such as .zip , .tar and .7z files, and WinCDEmu which allows us to mount image files such as .mds/.mdf , .iso . If you have downloaded a visual novel, and it came in a .rar/.zip/.7z archive, you must extract it before you can mount the installation files. You can use 7-Zip for this. Right click the archive > 7-Zip > Extract to %folder% Above is an example of extracting the archive using 7-Zip. After the archive has been extracted, we will now use WinCDEmu to mount the image that has been extracted from it. Right click the image > Select drive letter & mount > OK After that, The disc image is now mounted. You should see a new volume appear on your Explorer sidebar. .MDS/.MDF files It is a little different if you have .MDS/.MDF files, see below. Step 3. Installing the VN and applying patch \u00b6 Click on the new volume that appeared on your sidebar and run the installer. See below for details. Proceed with the installation, you may want to take note of where you installed the game. I installed Angel Beats! into D:\\Games\\KEY\\AngelBeats! If your visual novel came with a crack, you will need to apply this crack before you are able to launch the game. Cracks often come in the form of a .exe/.dll file found in folders/archives called \"AlphaROM\" or \"NoDVD\" or simply just \"Patch\" or \"Crack\", whatever it may be, copy these files into the installation directory of the game. Please note that you will not need to do this if you have bought the game. You can find an example below. After that, you should just be able to launch the game! Now go back to Visual Novel Guide to learn how to use Textractor with Yomichan. Steam Games \u00b6 If you obtained your visual novel from Steam, first check if \"Japanese\" is listed as a supported Interface and Subtitles language on the store page first. You can then set Japanese language within the Steam client itself. Open your Steam Library. From a game's library page, select Manage > Properties. Go to the Language tab. Select Japanese from the drop-down menu. In other cases, the game language can be set within the game itself. If you did not purchase the Steam game from Steam (i.e. a cracked game) you can edit the steam_api.ini file within the game's installation directory. language=japanese Windows: Troubleshooting \u00b6 Please insert original disc \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 Make sure you have applied the crack/patch. Some VNs require the original disc inserted at least once before it will launch. In that case, use WinCDEmu to mount the .ISO or .MDS as a DVD drive. If the problem persists, try restarting your PC.

Most VNs have anime-like visuals, and are usually accompanied by voice acting, background music and sound effects. Throughout the game, the player may be given choices, which will affect how the story will play out, so if you play it a second time, with different choices, you may get an entirely different plot. Why Visual Novels? \u00b6 Reading Japanese is extremely important, but not everyone loves reading books, you may feel fatigued after a while reading a standard, text-only novel but oddly enough you may be able to read VNs for hours without feeling fatigued. VNs have a mix of literary prose and conversational Japanese, so it is perfect for reading immersion. For the people that probably don't enjoy reading, and even find manga boring, VNs might just be perfect for you. Playing visual novels to learn Japanese \u00b6 This guide will go over how to play visual novels in Japanese and learn Japanese from them, this guide assumes you already have a Japanese visual novel set up and working, if not, check out Cross Platform VN Setup . Requirements: Textractor Yomichan Clipboard Inserter ( Firefox Version Here ) Texthooking Page A detailed Yomichan setup tutorial can be found here For most applications, use the x86 executable of Textractor. Steins;Gate If you wish to hook Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, please check out Steins;Gate Textractor Launch your VN and Textractor and first remove all the unneeded extensions by pressing the Del key. Remove the following: Bing Translate Any other translate Extra Window Extra Newlines Styler Order of extensions Your order of extensions is important. Here is what I usually recommend: - Remove Repeated Characters - Remove Repeated Phrases - Regex Filter (optional, but needs to be above clipboard) - Copy to Clipboard Now we need to attach Textractor to your VN. When it is attached, advance the text in the VN then cycle through the hooks to find the hook that matches the text displayed on the VN. Now open your browser, head over to my texthooking page make sure Clipboard Inserter is installed and enabled and then advance the text in the VN again. You can then just press Shift to use Yomichan. All done! Enjoy the reading!! You can track how much characters you have read using the indicator in the top right corner of the texthooking page. You can choose to keep the text when you refresh the page, or just the character count, or nothing. The texthooking page has an \"accurate character count\", meaning it does not count special characters and punctuation such as \u3002\u300c\u300d in the count. Can't hook? Try referring to the H-Code list @ Visual Novel Texthooking Wiki Little Busters! players, use the Ecstasy version and see this Need a walkthrough? \u00b6 If you are not used to visual novels, or games that make you make choices that decide the fate of the story, you may want to use a walkthrough. After all, you wouldn't want to get a bad ending. You can find walkthroughs by searching \u201c[vn name] \u653b\u7565\u201d e.g. \u201cAngel Beats! -1st Beat- \u653b\u7565\u201d. If you insist on not using a walkthrough, it is a wise decision to create a save file everytime you are faced with a choice. VN's often have 99+ save data slots, because they assume you'll be populating them with every decision point in the game. Unsure what to play? \u00b6 Have a look at visual novel lists below jamal's list This infamous list Dinuz's list Chronopolize's list The best visual novels ever made (according to VNDB rankings) Have fun reading! Consider joining our VN Club in the Discord ! Bonus: Using Textractor for PPSSPP Visual Novels \u00b6 Hooking PPSSPP Visual Novels require you to use the x86 (32-bit) version of PPSSPP along with the x86 version of Textractor. Launch PPSSPP (32-bit) Launch the Visual Novel. Attach Textractor (x86) to PPSSPP (32-bit) Advance the text in the VN (O button) Using the \"Search for hooks\" feature, select \"search for specific text\" Search for the specific text that is on the PPSSPP VN. It needs to be exact. It will take a while to search for the hook, your emulator may start to lag for a while.

Most VNs have anime-like visuals, and are usually accompanied by voice acting, background music and sound effects. Throughout the game, the player may be given choices, which will affect how the story will play out, so if you play it a second time, with different choices, you may get an entirely different plot.","title":"What are Visual Novels?"},{"location":"vn/#why-visual-novels","text":"Reading Japanese is extremely important, but not everyone loves reading books, you may feel fatigued after a while reading a standard, text-only novel but oddly enough you may be able to read VNs for hours without feeling fatigued.

If you want to setup Yomichan, you can find that here Yomichan Update Yomichan has been updated and since changed old classes and added new ones. This guide will no longer work. Please come back later when this message has been removed. The appearance of the Yomichan pop-up window can be modified with custom CSS found in the settings. In the v2 settings page, it can be accessed by going into \"Appearance\" then \"Configure custom CSS\" and \"Popup CSS\" There are many, many advanced modifications you can make with custom CSS, however, I will only go through a few examples. Headword \u00b6 The headword can be modified with the classes below: /* For kanji */ . kanji-link { } /* For kana & alphanumeric characters */ . source-text { } /* For furigana */ ruby { } Furigana Color If no color is specified for the ruby selector, it will be overridden by the source-text class. Example: changing font size and color of the headword \u00b6 With the following CSS: . kanji-link { font-size : 25 px ; color : #00FBFF ; } . source-text { font-size : 25 px ; color : #FA73FF ; } The result: This demonstrates differing font colors for kanji and kana. You may edit this to your heart's content. Definition \u00b6 The definition can be modified with the class below: . glossary { } Example: changing font of definitions \u00b6 Custom Fonts To use a certain font in Yomichan, the font must be installed on your system. You can find installed fonts in: Windows: C:\\Windows\\Fonts Linux: /usr/share/fonts or /usr/share/local/fonts or $HOME/.fonts macOS: /System/Library/Fonts or $HOME/Library/Fonts Newly installed fonts may require a system restart to be detected by Yomichan. With the following CSS: . glossary { font-family : MS Mincho ; /* Japanese serif font provided in Windows */ } The result: This demonstrates the changing of font for definitions to MS Mincho. Linux users may be able to use Noto Serif CJK JP as an alternative. Font installed, but not detecting? Try using quotation marks \"\" e.g. font-family: \"07\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3055\u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\"; Example: Using DJT's quiz font (funny) \u00b6 With the following CSS: /* You must have \u8861\u5c71\u6bdb\u7b46\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u884c\u66f8 installed on your system for this to work. */ . glossary { font-family : \"\u8861\u5c71\u6bdb\u7b46\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u884c\u66f8\" ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Tags \u00b6 Tags can be modified with the classes below: . tag { } . tag-label { } . tag-label-content { } Example: Removing all tags \u00b6 With the following CSS: . tag { display : none ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Example: Changing color of tags \u00b6 You can change the color of tags by changing the following variables below: : root { /* Light Theme */ # :root[data-theme=\"dark\"] { /* Uncomment for dark theme */ --tag-text-color : -- tag-border-color : -- tag-default-background-color : -- tag-name-background-color : -- tag-expression-background-color : -- tag-popular-background-color : -- tag-frequent-background-color : -- tag-archaism-background-color : -- tag-dictionary-background-color : -- tag-frequency-background-color : -- tag-part-of-speech-background-color : -- tag-search-background-color : -- tag-pitch-accent-dictionary-background-color : } Example: Full Nord Theme \u00b6 A full Nord theme I made for Yomichan can be found below: body { background : #2E3440 ; } . kanji-link { color : #ebffff ; } . source-text { color : #ebffff ; } . glossary { color : #ebffff ; } : root { --background-color : #2E3440 ; --tag-text-color : white ; --tag-border-color : transparent -- tag-default-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-name-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-expression-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-popular-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-frequent-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-archaism-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-dictionary-background-color : #8FBCBB ; --tag-frequency-background-color : #81A1C1 ; --tag-part-of-speech-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-search-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-pitch-accent-dictionary-background-color : #5E81AC ; --accent-color : #8FBCBB ; --text-color : #ebffff ; --pitch-accent-annotation-color : #ebffff ; --input-background-color : #3B4252 ; --reason-text-color : #5E81AC ; --notification-text-color : #ebffff ; --notification-background-color : #3B4252 ; --progress-bar-track-color : #D8DEE9 ; --light-border-color : #E5E9F0 ; --sidebar-background-color : #2E3440 ; --sidebar-button-background-color : transparent ; --sidebar-button-background-color-hover : #81A1C1 ; --sidebar-button-background-color-active : #6d88a3 ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color : transparent ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color-hover : #BF616A ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color-active : #8a373f ; --sidebar-button-icon-color : #ebffff ; --sidebar-button-disabled-icon-color : #808c8c ; --sidebar-button-danger-icon-color : #ebffff ; } :: -webkit-scrollbar { display : none ; } The result: Background \u00b6 Background can be edited with the selector below: body { } Example: Changing background color \u00b6 With the following CSS: body { background : #FFA8F8 ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Using image as background \u00b6 Chromium instructions for now To do this, you must install Yomichan dev build from GitHub instead of the Chrome Web Store, this is because we will be tampering with the files of the extension, which will be flagged if you get it from the Chrome Web Store. You can find it below. [GitHub] Yomichan Data All Yomichan data including dictionaries will be reset, you may be able to just copy the files over from your current Yomichan installation though. Download yomichan-chrome-dev.zip and unzip it anywhere on your computer. Now go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer Mode in the top right. Now click \" Load Unpacked \" and select the folder the .zip was extracted to. Now go to your Yomichan path which should be the same place you unzipped it and put your desired image in the fg folder. Now you can do the following CSS below. body { background-image : url ( \"name_of_file.png\" ) !important ; } The result: Miscellaneous \u00b6 Some misc. modifications you can do which I found cool. Removing current entry indicator \u00b6 Since Yomichan was updated, a blue indicator has been added. Which has been an annoyance for many long time Yomichan users. With the following CSS: . term-expression-current-indicator { display : none ; } The result: Removing progress bar \u00b6 With the following CSS: . top-progress-bar-container { display : none ; } Indicator and progress bar colors \u00b6 Alternatively, if you don't like the current color of the indicator and bar, you can change it rather than removing it. You can add the pseudo-class selector and custom property below: : root { --accent-color : #FF00DD ; /* Change color to a pink */ --progress-bar-track-color : #00F7FF ; /* Change bar track color to a blue */ } If you are using dark theme you need to have this instead: : root [ data-theme = \"dark\" ] { The result: Removing Edict markers \u00b6 In Edict dictionaries such as JMdict and KireiCake, there are markers that look like \u25cb which can be annoying for some. You can remove it by using the CSS below: . term-glossary-list { padding : 0 ; list-style-type : none ; } The result: Light / Dark mode varying CSS \u00b6 An example of varying CSS for light / dark modes can be found below. : root [ data-theme = \"dark\" ] { --glossary-color : #a89984 ; --ruby-color : #b8bb26 ; --kanji-text-color : #fabd2f ; --background-color : #282828 ; --accent-color : #689d6a ; --progress-bar-track-color : #458588 ; } : root { --glossary-color : #504945 ; --ruby-color : #98971a ; --kanji-text-color : #d79921 ; --background-color : #fbf1c7 ; --accent-color : #689d6a ; --progress-bar-track-color : #458588 ; } . kanji-link { font-family : UD Digi Kyokasho N-R ; } ruby { color : var ( --ruby-color ); } . source-text { font-family : UD Digi Kyokasho N-R ; } . term-glossary { color : var ( --glossary-color ); }","title":"Yomichan Custom CSS"},{"location":"yomicss/#yomichan-custom-css","text":"This is an optional tutorial.
